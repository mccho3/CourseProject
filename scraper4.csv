Another stellar weekend vaca!,"Love the Guesthouse - it is our go to spot in Chicago! Rick and the staff always make us feel right at home from the moment we walk in until the minute we check out. Comfy rooms, cozy wonderful beds, all the amenities you need in a nicely stocked kitchen, room to visit and enjoy time with family. We love the convenience and access to the Andersonville and Lincoln Square neighborhoods. There are several great coffee shops, restaurants, and wonderful shops near by and within walking distance. A new add right next door was Pick Me Up Cafe - a nice add to the neighborhood. We look forward to our next visit - it is already in the books!!",5
I finally have a wonderful place to stay that is truly dog friendly!,"I can‚Äôt say enough about The Guesthouse. Wonderful staff, beautiful spaces, great sheets and pillows, balcony with a view and my Greyhounds are welcome and comfortable:) I will most definitely be back!",5
Wonderful place to stay,"Great location, suites and staff were wonderful as well! Our dinner event space and coordination with caterer was handled so well by the hotel staff. Perfect! Only place we‚Äôll book for Chicago going forward!",5
Rude staff,Not a welcoming environment or experience! Staff behavior was rude and condescending. Desk staff demanded Identification for everyone in our group; insisting that we couldn‚Äôt proceed because our last group member was still bringing in her luggage. Although only one room key was given. Desk staff then proceeded to tell us that we needed to just ‚Äúdrink our wine and relax‚Äù for the evening as this is a quite rental. I have never been received like this by any hotel or resort I have ever stayed in. Although our accommodations were acceptable the staff was not!,1
Amazing hotel outside of downtown with all the amenities of home and very friendly staff!,"This place is amazing! Big thank you to Zoe, Paul, and Rick for all of their help during my stay! Very clean, and a home away from home. More like a condo than a hotel! Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again!",5
Absolutely Perfect for Long Term Stay!,"We often travel to Chicago/Andersonville to visit family, and over the years the Guesthouse has become our favorite hotel. In November we needed a place to stay for a full month during the COVID-19 lockdown. The Guesthouse became our oasis from the stresses of quarantining outside our family bubble. When we arrived, our apartment is spotless, as always. We love the spaciousness of the floor plan and the high ceilings. The shower in the master bath was luxurious -- five-star spa quality. The kitchen was fully equipped so that we could comfortably prepare and enjoy great meals for ourselves and also cook for our extended family. The grill on the deck was a bonus. I was able to reserve hour-long workout times in the downstairs exercise room, and I was also able to book the elegant library for Zoom meetings. The apartment is so quiet that you never know you‚Äôre in a lively urban setting. We loved having a reserved parking space in the garage, which was even equipped with an EV charger. The staff could not have been more helpful, attended our every need with great cheer. The Guesthouse tagline -- ""Live like a local""-- is spot on, and we hope to return again and again.",5
Perfect stay,Stayed there on a 6 day business trip. The location was perfect for relaxing in a quiet neighborhood after a busy day at the conference center downtown Chicago.,5
The best,Friendly people and more,3
Perfect for a staycation or celebration,"I'm a local Chicagoan and live in the neighborhood so have walked by this property many times. As a former hotel guy, I have always wanted to venture in and check out this property as it looks so nice from the outside. I finally had the perfect opportunity to throw a small engagement party for a couple of friends. Rick, the General Manager, could not have been nicer and the front desk staff was superb throughout the stay. I would highly recommend this to any out-of-town guest but also to any locals who have a good reason to put someone up in a beautiful suite for a night. I cannot wait to plan my next outing here!",5
"We just stayed here for regretfully only 2 nights. The rooms are absolutely amazing with how beautiful and humongous they are at a fantastic price per night. The folks who work there are super friendly and helpful. Had both restaurant food and grocery delivery to there while there without any issues. It's well worth not being right on Michigan Ave. Easy to get to those main areas in minutes whether Uber or similar services, CTA, or walking.",,3
Surprise Oasis in Chicago,We had to go to Chicago this past week and did not want to stay downtown. I found this hotel and was very impressed. We reserved a 3 bedroom suite. It was beautiful. The kitchen is fabulous. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were great. We were about a 10 minute Uber ride from downtown. The rooftop area at this property has a fabulous view of Chicago and is very comfy. It is nice to be out all day and come home and sit up there with a glass of wine. I was very impressed with the staff too. Our balcony/porch off the living room was perfect for an alfresco dinner. They do have car parking in private garages at the back of the units. Clean and comfortable. The living room and dining areas very very nice and comfy. This would be great for a long term stay and for families! Thank you for a a wonderful stay.,5
A heartfelt thank you to all of the staff at The Guesthouse Hotel for being available during one of the most challenging times of our lives. Your kindness and hospitality will be remembered always.,,3
Perfect home away from home,My friends and I were in Chicago for a weekend to hear some jazz at The Green Mill. Great club just a few blocks away from The Guesthouse.,5
Excellent Service,I've stayed here many times & the customer service & prices are always great. This is the only place I book when in Tricites. The rooms are clean but privacy is always respected. Flexible staff makes this a comfortable stay when on short notice.,5
Perfect stay at the Guesthouse,The rooms are amazing! We felt right at home.,5
Great stay! Would come back again,,3
"Fantastic place with huge, luxurious suites","I ""hosted"" my family and friends here for a family celebration and The Guesthouse Hotel delivered in every way. Rick and his crackerjack team took wonderful care of my guests, accommodating special requests like early check-in, a request for extra chairs.",5
Perfect for Living Like A Local in Chicago,"The Guesthouse Hotel in the northern neighborhood of Andersonville is super charming and offers all the comforts of home and then some. While it is some distance from the downtown Cloud Gate and other tourist attractions, it is nestled in a beautiful, very walk-able neighborhood with good shopping and awesome eats. It is actually not far at all from public transportation, though, if you want to explore other Chicago neighborhoods. I cannot say enough about the cleanliness or amenities. The suite's kitchen was fully stocked with wines glasses, Pyrex dishes and even a blender -I could have cooked a whole meal, served it, and then some! I had booked a one-bedroom suite and without even informing me, they gave me a two-bedroom suite which wad amazing. There were also two bathrooms which were spotless and stocked with delicious-smelling soaps and shampoos. I also appreciate that they left extra TP under the sink in both. I deeply appreciate the hotel policy to only clean upon request, as my husband and I were only there for two nights, so it would have been wasteful, and we usually don't like the invasion into our privacy anyway while travelling. The views off the terrace were not great, as we faced the back of the hotel, but it was fine. I had no plans to stare out the window all day. Check-in and check-out were fabulously smooth, quick and easy. Staff were super helpful, even though I had little occasion to interact with them as everything is really provided for at The Guesthouse Hotel. My only regret is that I didn't have my dog with me. as the hotel is sweet and dog friendly. I also would have liked to hang out in the very groovy and chill hotel library which was stocked with books. Also, even though it was February, the hotel did not have their lobby fireplaces going which was a bit of a bummer but I did not hang out in those spaces long so I can't complain... I truly loved this place and will be back.",5
No Hot Water ü•∂üöø,The location was great for what I needed. The $25 reserved garage parking was worth it. The room was as expected but there was never more than 5-10 minutes of hot water in the master bathroom; which meant I had to take 2 freezing cold showers during my stay. The first time I called down to the front desk and someone came up and verified the hot water heater was on. The second time I mentioned it at checkout and yet there was still no offer to make it right. I could probably understand if I had paid $40 a night but after paying almost $400 for one night; I left very dissatisfied and I won‚Äôt be staying there again. It was a very disappointing experience because I had such high hopes when I booked it.,1
Thanksgiving gathering location to meet new grand-daughter,"This was our second opportunity to be blessed with being able to stay at the Guesthouse Hotel in Chicago/Andersonville. Rick and the entire staff were nothing short of professional during our entire 10 day stay. They offered and brought up extra tables and chairs to accommodate our holiday family meal. They also brought up a lovely full size collapsable rolling baby crib which we liked so much we ordered one from the company and had it shipped to our home in Colorado. The location is ideal for easy walk to and through Andersonville to enjoy many of the wonderful shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Covered private parking was so appreciated especially during the blustery weather we had while there, Our apartment style residence was modern style, with very generous bright lighting. Beds and furnishings were very comfortable. The kitchen was more than adequate to prepare our Thanksgiving meal. This place meets all of our needs while in the Chicago area. Two time staying for a total of 15 nights has certainly had The Guesthouse Hotel earn our ""home away from home"" feel.",5
Highly Recommend!,This hotel has big modern apartment style rooms. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is located in a fun and safe local neighborhood just off the beaten path and close to great restaurants and bars.And all for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this property!,5
Lovely Visit at a Wonderful Hotel near Andersonville,"Rick and his staff at the Guesthouse could not have been more accommodating while we were there for 4 nights in Oct. Loved the spacious unit, the great location, the well-equipped kitchen, the easy parking, the privacy. A quiet retreat from an exciting city, and a true home away from home. Awesome place in every way, and we will be back, whenever we can!!!",5
A gem,"What an unexpected treat in the delightful Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago. Friendly, helpful, fun staff. Comfortable, spacious rooms replete with a fully functional kitchen, in-room laundry (full size washer and dryer), luxurious beds, and bathrooms with high-quality products. There are wonderful restaurants and shops in the ‚Äòhood as well as a delightful ‚ÄúMagic Lounge‚Äù down the street where we caught the hilariously arch performance of Lucy Darling (a highlight of our time. In Chicago!). While we paid around $15 per Lyft ride (including tip) to get downtown- the pleasure of this property and the neighborhood well made up for that expense.",5
Home Away From Home,"If you're looking for a place that feels more like a condo than a hotel, The Guesthouse Hotel is the spot for you. My husband and I stayed 5 nights and couldn't have been more comfortable. Plenty of space to store clothes so you're not living out of a suitcase. A kitchen stocked with all the essentials to make coffee, prepare meals, and reheat that leftover Chicago pizza. Having a washer and dryer made it possible to pack light. The staff was top-notch! Anything we needed, they were able to assist with. If you're looking for a place to truly experience Chicago neighborhoods, stay here instead of downtown.",5
Luxury and Privacy...,This place is amazing. Beautiful apartment with luxury finishes throughout. The staff are the most welcoming and attentive people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. This was our first of many visits. LOVE everything!! Close to amazing restaurants and attractions. The Andersonville neighborhood is so much fun.,5
More short term apartment than hotel,"I stayed for one night on a business trip. The place is clean and spacious. But it lacks basic hotel amenities. There is no food service on the premises, including at breakfast, where minimum breakfast items could have been offered. I took a 5 minute Uber ride to and from a nearby Starbucks for breakfast. This is more short term apartment than hotel. I also was surprised not to see a room safe in what I believe is a relatively new hotel.",3
Fant√°stico lugar ideal para vacaciones en grupo. Muy bien equipado con lo necesario y ubicado. . Calidad y comodidad,,3
Northside Gem,"My partner and I stayed here in October 2017 while some repairs were being done at our house in Chicago, and I put my mother and aunt up here in May 2019 when they visited us. The Guesthouse was terrific on all occasions. It's a quiet, comfortable base for exploring Chicago's Northside, within very short walking distance of dozens of restaurants and shops on Clark St. in Andersonville, and a slightly longer walk to Lincoln Square/Ravenswood and Uptown hot spots. If you're here for a Cubs game and don't mind a walk of a little over 1.5 miles, you can easily do that from The Guesthouse and be removed from all the Wrigley craziness after the game.",5
The Guesthouse Hotel Chicago... Home away from home,Wow we were so impressed with The Guesthouse Hotel. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everything was PERFECT. We were very comfortable. I drive a large SUV and they even reserved an individual garage to accommodate it. We loved it so much we are already planning another trip.,5
Market Days Fun!,"This spot was great! Stayed in a 2 bedroom apt and it felt like you were staying at someone's condo! So spacious, nice grill outside, cute patio, a small grassy area, and super clean! Also loved the products in the bathroom. Only thing I would say is to improve slightly on the water pressure in the shower. We stayed on the first floor all the way in the back, I think 115. Oh, and Adam at Reception was super chill and accommodating! I would definitely recommend!",5
Great Spot for a Group,"We had a medium sized family reunion at the Guest House and everything was absolutely perfect! Planning was easy working with Rick, and the property is beautiful We had great weather and enjoyed the rooftops often. The space is great, well appointed and in perfect repair. Enjoyed the location as well. We are avid bikers and rode the Lake Shore Path almost each day. Parked over a dozen bikes in a garage there. Some local favorites were Agami Sushi, Lady Greory's M Henri for dining. Enjoyed many pubs in Andersonville and Lincoln Square as well.",5
A beautiful find,"The Guesthouse Hotel is in a great location, outside of the central city but close to the El and in a wonderful neighborhood. We booked a 1 room and got a 3 room beautiful condo. The condo was first-rate and I wish we could have stayed for a month.",5
Almost better than home,"We stayed at the Guesthouse to attend our son's graduation at Northwestern in June. I am a difficult traveler, unfortunately, and rarely do I stay at an accomodation that is picture perfect. There are either issues with bed comfort, ammenities, hotel desk, noise, etc etc. But this WAS about as perfect as I could have ever expected. Not only did I feel like I was at a welcoming home, it seemed that no amount of planning was left out of the equation when the place was designed. A fully equipped kitchen, ultra clean silverware and other amenities, cozy living room with patio and grill, super clean bathrooms, very little noise infiltration from outside or next door in the rear bedroom and most of the place (though a bit more street noise on the Clarke Street bedroom side), and a really hip, friendly staff with a cozy lobby and library. Btw, I even noticed posts under each bed to keep them level (you now how sometimes beds tilt like see saws in a hotel?). The beds were just firm enough and provide nice rest after long days in town. (One very minor detail: There seem to be two wi-fi addresses and one is slow, but that's no big deal). So yes, I'd recommend this establishment in a heart beat - especially for hard-to - please travelers who demand perfection. )",5
"12/10 recommend! This hotel was gorgeous and made me want to move to Chicago! The staff was super sweet and they had so many activities for kiddos, too! The local treats were such a cute addition, too! Go up to the rooftop and fall even more in love!!",,3
Exceeded expectations- superb,"Stayed here for 3 nights in a 2 bed apartment. Perfect for exploring the historical Uptown and Andersonville areas. Everything we could possibly want was supplied even a huge washer and dryer. Wonderfully clean and light and airy. Already planning another visit this time for a week. Transport to City is easy but so much to see in the area, with Hopleaf being our favourite bar and restaurant. Thank you to the owners and Manager Rick. You made us fall in love with Chicago.",5
Beyond perfect,"This is an absolutely wonderful hotel with the feel of a home. My ‚Äúroom‚Äù, more like an apartment, was clean, bright, spacious, well appointed, and even more. The staff made me feel like a valued visitor. If you are in this part of Chicago you will be happy you stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel.",5
One-of-a-kind,"The usual hotel experience is using it as a launch pad to other experiences...a place where you sleep and then leave. Not at the Guesthouse. The accommodations are so comfortable and expansive compared to a hotel room, that we found ourselves spending hours there visiting, watching movies, reading, etc. The front desk staff was gracious yet relaxed. Nothing stuffy here, just friendly, solicitous and eager to help. The lobby and common area is beautiful AND comfortable and has an assortment of localized gifts and refreshments. Nothing is lacking. We walked into Andersonville everyday to enjoy its personality and amenities. A perfect trip thanks to our time at the Guesthouse. Looking forward already to our next visit.",5
Spectacular!,"If you're looking for ambiance, service, amenities, cleanliness, location, and value rolled up in appealing design, it's here! I arrived around midnight to a friendly staff, available sparkling water (my fav) and a jaw dropping room. The linens crisp, bed comfortable, modern bath, impressive kitchen, balcony, view and on I could go. You won't be sorry, only impressed and ready to find any reason at all to return.",5
Sooooo good!,"So much nicer than most hotels - the apartment was massive, proper kitchen, proper lounge, proper bathroom- it felt like I was at home. So clean that I assumed the hotel was brand new but now I see almost 400 other reviews! Lots of cafes nearby serving breakfasts that are way better than most hotel breakfasts. For me, it was a win!",5
It was like living coming home,"This hotel was like coming home to our condo. It had a full kitchen and garage. There was a grill and table/chair on the balcony. It was too cold to use any of that this trip. The kitchen was equipped with the basics if you wanted to cook. The place was really clean and smelled nice. The dog loved it too. The bathroom was down the hall from kitchen and living room which was nice for privacy. The kitchen counter had 4 or 5 stools that you could use to work or entertain at. It was close enough to walk to downtown Andersonville if the weather wasn't bad. This was such a nice hotel, it really felt like I lived there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that has kitchen needs or just wants time in a condo. I will be back to try out the weber grill. :) Bonus - a full size coffee maker and not a Krupp.",5
Our stay could not have been better,"What a lovely hotel! We stayed here mostly because we were catching a show at the Aragon Ballroom and it was walkable from this location. Totally made the right choice because The Guesthouse exceeded all expectations. The lobby is beautiful, yet also inviting and comfortable. The staff were awesome and the room fantastic. We weren't able to make use of the full kitchen other than to make coffee in the morning but if we'd stayed longer we'd have put it to good use. The balcony was an unexpected surprise and the bed was so very comfortable. The staff clearly care about the quality of your stay and offered helpful suggestions on where to eat and activities nearby to do. The neighborhood around the hotel is very walkable with restaurants and shops aplenty. We would certainly stay here again when visiting the Chicago area.",5
Just What We Needed,"I live near The Guesthouse Hotel and thought it would be great for a reunion gathering. I was right! The 3 of us shared a 3-bedroom, 2 bath apartment. The master bedroom had a wonderful steam shower, and the fully equipped kitchen was supplied with paper towels, dishwashing detergent, coffee, and tea (and a tea kettle in addition to the coffemaker). Parking was in garages with a remote overhead-door controller and much cheaper than downtown parking. Best of all was the gas fireplace; we spent a lot of time sitting in front of it and reminiscing. The staff was cordial and kind, always available for questions and quick at sending up supplies if we ran out. The Guesthouse is in easy walking distance of all kinds of restaurants, entertainment. and unique shops, some within a block or 2. If you need to be downtown and aren‚Äôt comfortable taking taking the great public transportation or driving the 8 miles or so to get there, this probably isn‚Äôt for you. But if you want a spacious, clean, comfortable accommodation in a great city neighborhood, this is it!",5
What a great place!!!!,"Stayed here 1 night, called to see if we could check in early, very accommodating and they made it happen.",5
Polar Vortex? Not a problem at the Guesthouse Hotel!,"Apt. 210 was cozy and warm with its fireplace and bright western windows. The building is a gem, super well-constructed, and all kept so clean you'd think no one had stayed there before you. Even the baseboards are clean. High ceilings lift your spirits in the dead of winter.",5
"Beautiful, homey, cozy and spacious","I recently stayed in one of the 2 Bedroom Deluxe Suites while I was recovering from foot surgery, and I cannot recommend it enough. The amenities and service here have been a godsend during recovery. The suite is so spacious that I had no problem maneuvering around the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms with a knee scooter/crutches. I was able to cook/prepare meals in the fully equipped kitchen with ease. The staff are incredible - friendly, attentive and willing to assist with anything at the drop of a hat. And, to top it all off, the cleanliness is impeccable. Congratulations to the housekeeping staff here - they are doing a stellar job.",5
Amazing Find,"One word... Awesome! It was definitely a home away from home. Check-in was quick and easy. The front desk staff was polite and took the time to explain the facility to us and get us checked in and parked. Andersonville is a great neighborhood and definitely needs more exploring. The guidebook provided many opportunities to look at. The room was perfect. These are suites, so you get a full kitchen... Take advantage of it. It definitely smelled like our neighbors on the 2nd floor were. Amazing smells the last couple of nights. The rooms are comfortable, the furnishing are nice and the rooms are well stocked and prepared. I will definitely be back.",5
"I recently had to come to town on an emergency to help my daughter with an unexpected surgery. I flew in from Montana... and desperately wanted to provide her with a comfortable space for a few days to relax and recoup...I am SO happy I found The Guesthouse Hotel... perfect!! in room laundry, clean and comfortable! Thank you so much to the staff for being so kind and accommodating. I HIGHLY recommend!",,3
Safe and sound.... truly a GUEST house!,"I recently had to come to town on an emergency to help my daughter with an unexpected surgery.

Home away from home,"What a wonderful experience. Checked into my beautiful, spacious suite. Full kitchen, laundry, 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms.",5
"Brilliant, all around!","We live down the street from this hotel and have stayed on numerous occasions while our home has been rehabbed. We cannot say enough great things about this hotel. The rooms are huge, clean, modern, gorgeous. All the details have been taken care of (e.g. recommendations on grocery stores to stock the fridge, cleaning supplies, robes, extra blankets, etc.). The staff is super helpful and very professional, as well as just plain nice! You can buy wine at the front desk as well as candies and other treats. The lobby is beautiful and inviting - there is a wonderful Chicago flair all over the hotel. My only regret in writing this review is the prices will go up when this hotel becomes super popular! All around, FANTASTIC stay!!",5
My home away from home,"I stay here whenever I visit my daughter.It ‚Äòs quiet, comfortable, great beds, spacious rooms, and fairly priced. I love it. Andersonville is just a few blocks away with lots of boutique shopping and restaurants.",5
This place is gorgeous! It's more like a small apartment than a hotel. Very roomy with a fully equipped kitchen. Private parking and laundry. It's better than I expected. Very clean and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!,,3
Just okay,"The place is conveniently located. We liked the fact that we could get an apartment style room, with a living room and two bedrooms. The staff are not unfriendly per se, just seemed uninterested or indifferent. They never bothered to tell us that it was tricky to find their parking lot. I would think that when they are dealing with guests coming from out of town, they would take the time to explain a thing or two. We had to call a couple times to ask where to park. Then after figuring out where the lot was (behind the hotel, need to use a different street to get there) we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to ENTER the place from the lot!! We called 3 times, it was like pulling teeth. The guy just couldn‚Äôt be bothered to EXPLAIN. I don‚Äôt know what we would have done before the cell phones were invented!? It was raining, and no one offered to help with anything. We didn‚Äôt expect a concierge or bellman, but they should really train the front desk staff to pay more attention to the customers.. to put themselves in the guests‚Äô shoes. What would you do if you had never been there? What if you were from out of town or out of state? That kind of thing. Enough said.",2
"Our stay was so enjoyable. Accommodations were spotlessly clean and spacious. Front desk staff (especially Adam) were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Dog friendly. Provided dog bowls in the room for your pup and water & treats in the lobby. Definitely would stay here again.",,3
"Everything about this place is just Cool!! The History the Location, Our room was So Nice and Masterfully updated it‚Äôs better than some New hotels! One of the most awesome things is the View! At night it‚Äôs AMAZING! Almost a 360* view with the entire downtown skyline from the Rooftop Cafe. Warning; There Is a Cemetery across the street but I think it only Adds More Character and Excitement to the appeal. Mid 19th Century and Civil War history buffs will find A Lot to check out. The Amenities are Top Notch, they even had treats for my Dog At check-in! This place IS the REAL DEAL!! FIVE STARS!!!",,3
"Amazing experience!! Beautiful condos, heated garage parking, friendly staff. AND it‚Äôs dog friendly with cute accommodations for your dog!! This was my first time here but it will not be my last!! üôåüèº",,3
best place to stay in Chicago!,"I've been to Chicago and stayed downtown before on the Magnificent Mile. This is the place to say- the prices are the same, but you have 600 square feet instead of 200 square feet.What a great value! Their slogan says it all- live like a local. The kitchen was beautiful and well appointed. The staff was so fantastic and friendly - you can tell they love Andersonville. It was within walking distance of many shops and restaurants, and markets to stock the kitchen. It was a quiet stay too which we appreciated.",5
Great For Family Events,"Our daughter married a wonderful gentlemen in Chicago. Both our family and the groom‚Äôs family stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel for a long weekend of wedding events and family activities. There aren‚Äôt enough superlatives to describe our experience at this wonderful boutique hotel From the spacious, clean and well-stocked accommodations to the excellent, friendly staff to the best general manager we ever met, Rick Verkler, we have gathered so many special memories. On top of all that we hosted a Vietnamese Tea Ceremony that Rick helped to bring to a success. My wife and I highly recommend the Guesthouse and would give it more than five stars if we could. As soon as we receive photos from the photographers we will post them.",5
Wonderful stay in Chicago,"The Guesthouse was everything they advertised and more. We would the accommodations extremely clean and amenities plentiful. The location was ideal for both exploring the local fare, shopping, and fast access to other parts of Chicago.",5
Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for our honeymoon in Chicago. It‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful hotel, and the staff really look after you. It‚Äôs in Andersonville, which is about 20 minutes from downtown Chicago - we loved that we saw parts of the city we probably wouldn‚Äôt have if we‚Äôd stayed in the more touristy areas. Lots of lovely little restaurants and bars nearby too. Recommend if you want to experience something outside the tourist norm. Thanks for having us guys!",5
"It‚Äôs perfect‚Äîlike having your own condo. With a well equipped kitchen, eating in is a real option. Friendly staff.",,3
Wedding Weekend!!,Outstanding!! Hosted a portion of the guests and held the rehearsal dinner at The Guesthouse last weekend. What a fantastic time we all had - Rick and his team were accommodating and attentive to so many of the details. We have stayed at the Guesthouse in the past and loved it - now that we have also held an event there we love it even more. Others in our party offered compliments too and on a scale of 1- 10 we rate Rick and his team an 11!!! Can‚Äôt wait to go back.,5
"Beautiful rooms very spacious great location and price! Clean comfortable, within walking distance of shops ,boutiques.",,3
Incredible place !!!,What a nice hotel in AndersonVille,5
Like staying at home,Incredibly well run and maintained property with supporting staff that are friendly and helpful. The rooms are like living in your own home with no feeling of staying in a hotel. The location was perfect with a wide range of diversity and options.,5
"Excellent ""Boutique Hotel"" choice for groups/families","Spent a long weekend in town with reunion group of friends from college. Great amenities, easy walk to the Red Line train. Quiet, clean. Perfect for families and small groups. Fantastic views from Rooftop patio. Will stay here with the wife and kids next time we come to Chicago.",5
Group trip,"I was in town for a Cubs game and concert with friends. The hotel was amazing. We had 4 rooms for the 12 of us. Very spacious and plenty of room. Would not have been able to been as comfortable in a traditional hotel. All of our rooms had full kitchens, patios with grills and plenty of seating. This allowed us to congregate in 1 room for meals and hanging out. the staff was friendly, engaging and very responsive. An added benefit was the private garage parking. Location was perfect. Able to walk to coffee shops, 24 hour restaurants and night life. Will definitely be back.",5
Great place Great staff,"Great place makes you fell like your at home. Comfortable, beautiful and located close to everything. We checked in on a Friday night and the young man at the desk Jeremias I believe was his name was welcoming, friendly & extremely helpful. Beautiful lobby & common area. Recommend this place and staff for a at home stay away from home.",5
Lovely hotel with great facilities and very friendly staff,This is a little gem in a very pleasant area of Chicago. Don‚Äôt be put off as it is in suburbs as there is an L Train stop nearby and you can quickly and cheaply travel right into the city centre. You are also within walking distance of Wrigley Field.,5
Great place to stay,"The Guesthouse is a great place to stay in Chicago without being downtown. Close to Andersonville and Wrigley field. Rooms are small apartments, well equipped with kitchen beds and baths. Some have balconies and/or fireplaces. Nice touches throughout.",5
"Great stay, but cheap add ons after leaving","We were visiting Northwestern with my daughter, but could not find a hotel in Evanston. The guesthouse looked nice so we decided to try it. We arrived by taxi from the airport about midnight. The driver was lost and brought us though a dark alley. I was scared to get out, but when we saw the room I was amazed. It was fantastic. We had a two bed room and was very large with hardwood floors excellent bedding, and much nicer than the online pictures even suggests. In the light of day the area is fantastic. Lots of neat restaurants. Easy to jump on the ""L"" to go to Evanston or Chicago. There was evan a washer/dryer in the room.",4
Living like a local,"We are from Michigan and visit friends in Chicago many times per year, there is no place we would ever stay! The location cannot be beat, the apartment/condo style rooms make you feel like you never left home!",5
Outstanding!,What a great place to stay. It really feels like your own apartment. We stayed here as a family in a 3 bedroom suite and used Lyft to visit the city. It was a convenient and affordable drive and nice to get away from the crowds in the evening. Using lyft is less expensive than a rental and high parking rates in the city. We ordered our groceries and Peapod delivered them. The staff was amazing and put them upstairs for us. We arrived before check in and they held our luggage so we could get another day of touring in. We loved the washer and dryer so we could pack light. Amenities are all you need. The steam shower is amazing! Everything is as nice as the web page - we would stay here again!,5
Beyond Expectations!!!!,"This place was absolutely incredible!! Beautifully decorated, fantastic beds and so much room!! We had the 2 bedroom suite and loved the deluxe shower with multiple heads and steamer. We had a garage with opener, BBQ pit on the patio, washer and dryer- simply every amenity you can think of!!",5
"My husband, myself, and our two dogs stayed here for 3 nights while our condo was under construction. The Guesthouse is your home away from home. This boutique hotel is magnificent. Each suite is the size of a large condo and comes fully stocked with a full kitchen, washer dryer, grill, and anything you need to cook or bake. The staff is also extremely welcoming and very helpful. If your thinking about visiting Chicago and want to stay walking distance from Andersonville and Wrigley Field this is the place. We‚Äôre happy to be back in our home but in the event we need a pet friendly hotel this is our #1 choice.",,5
"As former Chicagoans, we normally stay in some of the boutique hotels downtown when we return as visitors. A friend reccomended we try The Guesthouse and we are really glad we did. Great location for visiting all the Northside locations. The hotel itself was perfect for us, we had the 2 bedroom suite and wish we had time to sty longer. Our new favorite place.",,5
This hotel is the best find. The 2 bedroom units have to be 1000 sq foot with 13‚Äô ceilings. Really nice. We are coming back. And so close to Andersonville!!,,5
Heavenly Comfort,"My sister-in-law, twelve-year-old niece, and I went to Chicago to see Hamilton and do some sight-seeing. I wanted a hotel with space and two bathrooms, a must have for three women! We really hit the jackpot with the Guesthouse! From the minute we walked through the door, I knew we're made the right choice. The lobby is comfortable and classy and the person behind the front desk was so welcoming. The two bedroom, two bath suite we stayed in was amazing. They really thought of everything for guests from the fully equipped kitchen, to the make up mirrors, jewelry dishe on the night stand, super comfortable beds, and fluffy towels. Easy walking distance to the grocery store made it convenient to have fresh fruit and bagels and snacks in the room, so we didn't need to rush out in the mornings. Everyone we met at the hotel was friendly and knowledgeable about the area and Chicago, especially Rick! It was so nice to have a true home away from home to relax in and plan our adventures for each day. I can't imagine how crammed we would have been if we had chosen a hotel in downtown Chicago, and we're would have been miserable with just one bathroom. I can't say enough about this gem. If you are planning a trip to Chicagoland, look no further for a truly exceptional place to stay. I highly recommend The Guesthouse and can't wait to go back with my husband!",5
"Comfortable, convienent",Stayed here for 4 days on a business trip.,5
Great Room,"The room was fantastic. I want to retire to an apartment or townhouse just like the 3 bedroom deluxe we rented. Hotel was clean, employees were friendly and helpful.",5
Relaxing weekend in Chicago,"I live in the Chicago suburbs. My wife and I decided to spend the weekend near downtown so we stayed 2 nights at the Guesthouse. This was our second stay. The unit was two bedrooms, two baths...plenty of space and very clean. Would definitely come back as well as recommend the Guesthouse. Glenn",5
Hidden Gem!,"Like staying in the lovely vintage-but-updated condos you see on HGTV---cozy, warm, quiet, professional, accommodating and spotless! If you know the city, feel free to stay here even though it's technically not downtown. And if you don't? Know that it's a quick & under $20 Lyft/taxi anywhere if you're not into public transport (also plentiful)! Darling lobby too!",5
Home away from home.,"We had a wonderful experience. We had groceries delivered by Peapod which the staff had put away prior to our arrival. The place was very clean and was spacious enough for me, my husband and my mother. The elevator broke one day so my elderly mother had to go up four flights of stairs one day which was pretty tough on her. When we came back that evening the staff gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for the inconvenience. I would highly recommend the GuestHouse to everyone and we will for sure be back when we visit Chicago again",5
"An exceptional place to stay - we spent our last two nights as Chicagoans here after hearing rave reviews from my dad and brother, who stayed here when they came to visit us a few months ago. It could not have been more perfect for our needs. I will definitely look into staying here when we return to visit from our new home in Michigan!",,5
Fantastic apartment hotel,"Our family stayed in one of the 3 bedroom apartments. We were looking for someplace convenient and with enough sleeping space. For the slightly higher cost than a traditional hotel room, this was amazing. The apartment had all of the amenities like a standard hotel and all of the upgrades (appliances, flooring, granite countertops, etc). We were very comfortable. The staff was very kind and knowledgeable about the area. They also have a good selection or snack and beer/wine for purchase in the lobby if you haven‚Äôt gotten to a store yet. There were a lot of restaurants within walking distance. The train and buses were very close as well. We were able to walk to the train and take that and the buses to the museum park area for the planetarium and aquarium. Our trip was fantastic and we will definitely stay here again when we come to Chicago. We highly recommend this hotel.",5
Amazing place,"We love this place - high quality and very comfy apartments, great for longer stays. We‚Äôre definitely coming back!",5
"We hosted my wife's wedding shower at The Guesthouse. It couldn't have been better! The first floor space is very comfortable, with a chic but historic feel to it. You have the ability to keep things open or separate them off. While it was a bit chilly, we also had access to the awesome roof with breathtaking views. The staff made everything very easy, connecting us with local vendors and making sure everything went off without a snag. We highly recommend The Guesthouse for both events and the rooms are nicer than any apartment I've lived in!",,5
Best 30th Birthday Ever!,"When planning for my 30th birthday party, I knew I wanted to have it somewhere chic and spacious for my friends and I to celebrate. I found The Guesthouse Hotel listed on the LGBT Chamber of Commerce of Illinois web site, and immediately loved the photos and knew it would meet my needs. I was not upset! I rented the three bedroom suite (AMAZING IN EVERY WAY!) and everyone loved it! It was spacious, beautiful and a great space. The staff was super helpful and quick to respond to text messages when I needed help. The space was clean and the building was very quiet. Parking was great (free after 6pm). Checking in and out was also very simple.",5
Weekend in Chicago,Was in Chicago for a meeting over the weekend. The Guesthouse Hotel was recommended by a colleague. Loved everything about it. It is small enough to get personal attention and large enough to have your privacy. The rooms are spacious and well designed. This is super property.,5
Perfect place to enjoy Andersonville. Can‚Äôt miss!,,5
Incredible Home Away From Home,"This is an incredible comfortable, clean, spacious, suite space. Truly extraordinary. Nestled in a wonderful city within the city of Chicago with a wide selection of restaurants and shops. There are a plethora number of reasons The Guesthouse Hotel is ranked in the Top Places to Stay while in Chicago. Whether you are here for business or pleasure you will fall in love with the exceptional accommodations and staff of The Guesthouse.",5
A Fantastic Place to Stay,This Dec. 29-Jan3 was the third time we have stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel -twice for New Years Eve with family (3 bedroom) and once in the Spring with friends in a 2 bedroom. The Guesthouse is the only place we want to stay when in Chicago!,5
Awesome apartment at a good location!,"I stayed at this ""hotel"" for 4 days.",4
Lovely property and great for an extended stay,"What a sweet place to stay in Chicago! It is in an interesting neighborhood, the apartments are nicely decorated and comfortable, parking is secure, and they have created a great option to downtown. This is the kind of place to which I will return.",5
Great accommodation,Wonderful apartment style accommodation clean tidy nicely appointed. Convenient location and close to several restaurants. Not far from pale which makes a great place to run. Wonderful staff that were helpful,5
Absolutely perfect!,"I loved every minute of my mini-vacation while staying here. This was an amazing place, even better than the photos. It was so comfortable and relaxing to stay in what was basically an apartment. The location is great. So much to do nearby and so easy to get to. Everything was immaculately cleaned and the suite had everything we could ever hope for. We were so comfortable staying here, it was sometimes hard to make ourselves go out for the evening. I will always be recommending this place to my friends. I seriously couldn't have asked or hoped for anything more.",5
Highly Recommended,"Why stay downtown when you can stay in the lively and interesting neighbourhood of Andersonville in a large and impeccable 1, 2 or 3 bedroom suite with all mod cons. This hotel is indeed a gem. The staff are friendly and helpful, the parking is reasonable, and the suites have everything you need for a home away from home. Good access to shopping, restaurants and to downtown.",5
One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Gorgeous atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we could have stayed longer.,,5
Home away from home.,"My husband and I stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel while visiting our daughter who lives nearby. We were so impressed with the greeting we received from the staff. The lobby is beautiful with coffee on hand when ever you need a boost. We were given an upgrade to a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was well appointed, the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. The location is great for a neighborhood feel and just down the street a few blocks we found great restaurants. Bar Roma being one of them. There is a very nice grocery store near by and the hotel offers a service for grocery delivery, which I would take advantage of next time. I recommend this for families or small groups vacationing in Chicago. We will stay here again without any hesitation. The neighborhood feel gives your visit a relaxing stay with less chaos of the downtown area. The Spa next door looks really nice. If you don't like to travel with the unknowns that come a long with some rentals, stay here.",5
Excellent place with excellent people working there!,"It had lots of charm and class. So did the people that worked there! From the time I first called and spoke to Jo and Rosemary to book our trip, everyone was so attentive, and excited about our coming there. They really take pride in working there. If you visit, you will see why. From the cleaning ladies and their happy moods and friendly way, to Victoria, just full of information at the front desk, and the manager Rick, who made our stay there so special. So comfortable and clean with a full kitchen! It was like our own apartment in Chicago! Such a great memorable stay...Loved it!",5
The Gem in the Crown,"The Guesthouse Hotel is a hidden gem in a fantastic city. Our group of eleven could not have done better in many respects including staff, space, price, d√©cor and kitchen suite. It did make the location, view across from a cemetery, area noise and lack of on-site bar/restaurant pale in comparison although a concern at first. The hotel is impressive with a rooftop area for guests to gather, a small but adequate work out area, gift shop and library with computer/printer. Although not of concern for us it is pet friendly and they have a welcoming dish of food and water. The 3- bedroom suites are spacious, spacious (can I repeat), spotless and come with a culinary delight of a kitchen (supplied with first class dishes, utensils and glasses for ten) Canadians might suggest or could purchase a teapot for future guests. The jewel in the crown is the staff and owners. They not only exude but capture competence, business acumen and clients because they are accommodating, sensitive, proactive and can find your reservation and keep you updated in a second. We originally made a reservation for 2016 marathon and ended up postponing until 2017 due to a cancer diagnosis. We wanted to be able to gather together and celebrate and the hotel credited us back our original deposit and allowed the postponement. They also had complimentary cookies, refreshments and snacks for athletes. We could not be happier with the outcome.",4
"Sublime, with out any trace of the hectic world out side, I didn't want to leave.",,5
My favorite place to stay in Chicago. Really nice. Good prices. Clean. Awesome part of town to be in. I always try to book there.,,5
Beautiful hotel. Really enjoyed our stay. Wish my apartment was as nice!!,,5
Absolutely A+ experience!,A previous reviewer mentioned that she would give this place 10 stars if she could - I absolutely echo that!,5
NIce stay but noisy,"We had a generally nice stay at the hotel. As others have said, if you really need the extra space, this is the trade-off of being further from the museums, tourist destinations etc. The Vietnamese community nearby had excellent restaurants. Having a washer/dryer is also great. The fitness center is very limited in its equipment and in a very small room--in case that is important to some. The staff was very attentive and responsive. I imagine that unless you stay on the top floor, the noise of upstairs neighbors walking above your unit is always an issue--it definitely disturbed our sleep. The walls are very thin. Our unit was also next to the elevator so the noise from that also kept us up. Check in at 4 and check out at 10 makes for an expensive and shortened night, however, they will store your luggage and housekeeping must really need the 6 hours to clean since the apartment was spotless. And, of course, being across the street from the Catholic cemetery might also be a deal breaker for some.",5
"Beautifully appointed, modern suites in a quiet neighbourhood close to attractions.","I love this hotel!!!!!!!! My husband, friends, and their children arrived as last-minute refugees from a disastrous Airbnb fail, and the minute we walked into the lobby and were greeted so warmly at reception, we all let out a huge sigh of relief. So first things first, I always like to say something about the area that a hotel is in because location is important. I like to walk everywhere so safety and convenience are important. The hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to many amazing places to eat and drink in a wide range of price-points, from very affordable family-run amazing Mexican food, to fancy spots with intriguing menus. The L is walking distance. The hotel has covered parking.",5
There is no other hotel experience like this is in Chicago. Highly recommend visiting and staying at the Guesthouse. Warm and inviting staff with an extensive knowledge of the area. Don't stay anywhere else.,,5
"I would go back to Chicago just to go to the Guesthouse. It's in one of my favorite neighborhoods in the country, feels like you're at home, but is still a total escape.",,5
No Place Like The Guesthouse,"I had the privilege of staying here early this week and found this place to be extraordinary. The condo/hotel room was immaculate, tastefully decorated, stylish and elegant. When you enter the lobby you are greeted by a very friendly and hospitable staff whose main goal is to insure your comfort. We had a spacious 2 bedroom with separate bathrooms. The stainless steel appliances, coffee maker and fully stocked kitchen were convenient for us if we decided to have meals in our room. The patio also has a gas grille and there are grocery stores in walking distance. The staff prides themselves on using locals for the snacks and products and all the toiletries were hand made. The view from the loft was amazing! Rick and your team thank you for the hospitality! We will be back very soon!",5
Adding our vote to a 5-star experience,"Looking at the other reviews, we heartily concur - had never been to this part of Chicago before and were looking for a place close to an event we were attending, which was mostly the basis of our choice. But having stayed there, we would choose to go back no matter where we were headed in Chicago. It is beautiful inside, we were upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite that was spacious, well-appointed and really had everything you could want (or if not, could get from the attentive staff). The neighborhood is a few blocks off from the nicest part of N. Clark, but don't let that put you off from a truly special experience.",5
Excellent place to stay for short term or an extended period.,,4
Home away from home,"We booked the guesthouse hotel on the strength of their TripAdvisor status and because it met our accommodation needs for a family of 4 adults. Initial impression was a bit of uncertainty concerning its location right opposite the cemetery and in amongst the auto body/car repair shops and quite a distance out from the city. Never the less, as recommended by our very friendly and attentive hosts we explored the little village on foot and we found many interesting shops and plenty of restaurant options. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment and the standard of the accommodation is simply outstanding. I am an attention to detail person and every aspect of the apartment is carefully thought through down to the last detail. The only aspect missing (that I noticed) was a safe which is usually provided standard, (and which could easily be added) for safekeeping of passports and other important documents in order to provide travelers with some peace of mind. We utilized the sofa bed in the lounge as well, and there was even a memory foam topper provided for its use, and our adult daughter who used it said she slept very well. The washer & drier was great as we arrived in Chicago at the end of a week long cross country trip so we were happy to have the use of those. The heating in the room was very efficient. We stayed 2 nights and as mentioned by other reviewers there is no housekeeping during the stay (this can be requested if required) but to be honest with a dishwasher provided as well, this was really not required for such a short stay. We asked for extra coffee and creamer and that was no problem. The information provided in the room concerning restaurants in the area sorted by category was very helpful and we definitely took the suggestions on board and found some outstanding restaurants which we otherwise would never have known about. Lastly when our flight was delayed out of Chicago the management graciously extended our checkout time at the last minute so we could leave a bit later and not have to wait extra hours in the airport. We used uber and that made the commuting part effortless. If suburban living is your choice, I'd definitely recommend you stay here, no hesitation.",5
"If you want to feel at home, stay here","Guesthouse is the best of a Hotel and an apartment. We loved the spacious rooms, high ceilings, contemporary design details and full kitchen, washer/dryer. We saw a ball game at Wrigley and had business in Evanston so the location on North Clark/Andersonville was perfect.",5
Great stay at your establishment. Very roomy and accommodating.,,5
Awesome Andersonville-Wrigley Field Hotel,"My husband and I spent three nights at this hotel in late February when we were in Chicago for a wedding. I understand the hotel was built as a condominium but the units were not sold. I think there are 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom units--all with full kitchens. There is no daily housekeeping service unless requested. Our 2-bedroom 2 bath unit was wonderful. I saw one 3-bedroom that had a gas fireplace and a separate dining area. Our unit had eating at a granite bar/island. This is an easy walk to the Andersonville area. Probably a bit further to Wrigley Field (we went by it on the bus into Chicago. There are also metro options to get into downtown Chicago. Lots of restaurants in the area and a large grocery store. The staff was friendly and helpful. Recommend!",5
Family setting,"The rooms were clean and large, good supply of clean linen, temperature control was excellent. Closets with plenty of shelves or hanging space. Kitchen and baths were outstanding, clean, spacious, and with multiple options. Responsive staff. Washer and dryers were of current model and capabilities. The gas grill and fireplace were a welcome feature.",5
"Interesting, quirky, very different","The huge number of fans of The Guesthouse hotel in Chicago will not appreciate me saying it is not the #1 hotel in Chicago in my opinion. Though according to Trip Advisor it is, and so it stands",3
Not Recommended!,"Could not understand why this Hotel has such high ranking. The pros: it's spacious and clean, as in the photos, and the beds are comfortable.",3
Lovely suite hotel,My husband and I stayed here the night the cubs won the World Series. It was a good value for high quality lodgings. Staff were super friendly. Free coffee and nice areas to lounge in. Large room to hold meetings in. There was 2 of us but the suite was spacious and 4 could have stayed without feeling crowded.,5
Really classy place. We will definitely put it on our list of great small hotels.,,5
"Thank you for providing the perfect backdrop for Delores's event!! Your professionalism, HOSPITALITY, and willingness to help out wherever needed is UNMATCHED!! I will be referring your establishment to any and everyone who asks!! Thank you Veronica (my new BFF) and Adam (my tech-savvy-awesome coffee-making genius)! You guys were such a blessing! I cannot thank you guys enough for your impeccable service!! the honoree, the giddy college graduate and NEW business owner and everyone in attendance was totally blown way!! PHENOMENAL!! Can't wait to get back to the best house, eh-em, I mean the Guesthouse!! :)",,5
I would rather stay somewhere else.,"I have some minor complaints- they don't tell you that they don't clean your room if you stay more than 1 night. This mostly bothered me because they dont restock the coffee and creamers. They didn't provide any tea as well. They have a full kitchen but don't provide coffee, cream or tea which every Holiday Inn has. Also, they don't provide a charging station for electronic devices in the room. I have gotten used to having when I travel.",3
LOVED IT!,"Such an amazing place to stay. Located in Andersonville, a great neighborhood by the way, with plenty of restaurants & cool shops. Stayed at Guesthouse as we were seeing a show at the Aragon Ballroom & the opening band stayed at our hotel! Staff very friendly; condo-style room very clean & super quiet. Parked our car in an actual residential style garage & we didn't have to worry about our vehicle's safety. Balcony has chairs & bbq grill but it was too cold to use it. Nearby store on same block has good meat should you choose to grill outside. Wish we could live there!!",5
Great place to stay,"We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite. First of all the entire suite was so clean I couldn't believe anyone had stayed in it before us. It was more spacious than I had imagined. The front desk staff were very nice but essentially it just felt like we had an apartment to come and go from as we pleased for the time we were there. We were in town for a wedding and had family over one night for pizza. There was ample room for games and talking, plenty of dishes and glasses for everyone. It is also easy walking distance to many nice shops and restaurants, as well as the lake shore. We had our dog with us and it was really nice to be able to leave him in the suite when we went out. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.",5
Hidden Gem,"I grew up southside Chicago. Andersonville (where Guesthouse is located) is a hidden gem! The Guesthouse was lovely - friendly, clean with uber comfy beds! Parking was easy & convenient. Staff was beyond helpful even with securing babysitter! No need to travel away from area for food - great local spots - Bar Roma was phenomenal! The shops were super fun. Lincoln Park ridiculously close & the zoo has had many updates since I was last there!",5
Return to Chicago after many years,"After more than 25 years away we had a weekend getaway to Chicago. We loved the Guesthouse Hotel. The new, clean, Suite style room was excellent. Clean, well furnished with supplies. The staff was friendly and very helpful in accessing transportation and finding the local hotspots",5
Wonderful Staff in a beautiful hotel,"What a great experience, staying here. Had a jacket button issue 10 minutes before leaving for a wedding; front desk provided everything needed. Consistently helpful and informative. Lovely condo-style room, and a really great bathroom. Walking distance to so many things, including the train station to easily get into Chicago. I'd stay here again anytime!",5
Perfect for family get together,"We had two 2-bedroom suites for our family of seven (including one toddler) who were arriving from 3 different cities for a family wedding. The space and amenities were phenomenal. The kitchen is fully equipped and you're able to cook a quick breakfast or snack, or eat your carry-in on real plates. They provided not only a crib (expected, of course) but also a high chair, stroller, toys, books, and a baby monitor! Really saved the hassle of traveling with a baby! The staff members were all very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were nicely furnished and spacious; the bathrooms were well appointed. My only (small) disappointment was that there are no TV's in the bedrooms--only one TV in the living room. Having a parking garage on premises saved the worry of on-street parking. All in all, a GREAT place to stay with a family. The price was fair for all they had to offer.",5
"A great, clean place to stay.","We stayed at The Guesthouse while our Condo was being renovated due to water damage. The staff was very friendly and courteous, and went out of their way to make us feel at home. In addition, staying at the Guest House offers you a homey feel away from home instead of feeling like you are staying in a hotel. Highly recommended.",5
Weekend Escape,"Our stay at the Guesthouse could not have been more perfect. The suite was gorgeous, modern, fully stocked and immaculately clean. The mood and atmosphere of the hotel allowed us to completely relax and enjoy our time together. The staff was friendly, responsive and available. There are a variety of types of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Perfect location. Perfect hotel. Perfect escape. We definitely plan to return as often as possible.",5
BEST HOTEL EVER!!!,"The Guesthouse by far is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. It truly is a home away from home. Every part of our unit was immaculate, from the bathrooms with luxurious towels to the beds that were amazingly comfortable. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to go back!!!",5
Definitely will stay here again,"My family has visited Chicago regularly for the past five years, staying in several centrally located hotels, all very fine and with great amenities. But,The Guesthouse is definitely at the top of my list. We stayed four nights in a 2BR/2 bath unit which was super spacious and gracious. And the hotel is conveniently located, with nearby shops and restaurants and an easy walk to public transportation. Stay here and live like a local, it's so much more enjoyable!",5
Stay like a local!,"This isn't a hotel, it's a home. We were all charmed by our 3 bedroom unit. I loved the kitchen, with the Jenn-aire appliances, and amazingly well appointed kitchen. Garlic press? Yes, please!",5
The best hotel in Chicago,"I have stayed at a lot of really nice hotels in a lot of different cities and this one was by far the best. I stayed there with my mother, daughter and three dogs. The staff and the owner were so amazingly friendly and accommodating and made us all feel right at home and welcome. A staff member even brought up dog beds and dog food bowls for my dogs. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything I could need to cook with and serve dinner with for worry free cooking and cleaning up after. You can even have groceries or restaurant food delivered to your suite. The living room was comfortable and elegant. The bedrooms we are so comfortable and so wonderfully decorated I never wanted to leave. The area that the hotel is located in was very Chicago and I felt like a Chicagoan. It's pricey but worth every penny. I will stay there every chance I get. Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!",5
"Great location, helpful staff","We stayed in one of the two bedroom units for four days. The location was great - walking distance to a number of unique shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and easy access to public transportation and freeways. The room was immaculate and nicer than the photos. I had a few issues figuring out the DVD player and washing machine, but a call to the front desk and, within minutes, someone was there to help me out. The library was stocked with movies, books and games - a nice option when staying in at night. The only thing we didn't love was the couch - since it is also a sleeper sofa it was a bit uncomfortable to sit on.",5
Home Away from Home! Full Service Boutique Hotel,I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities and the style in this full service hotel. They had everything that anyone could hope for including a garage with an opener! I booked it because of the price and location not realizing what a gem of a property that we would be staying at. The staff was friendly and very helpful. It was extremely clean and well stocked. You could stay for a night or move in for an extended period. We were extremely impressed.,5
Outstanding,This is probably one of the best places I have ever stayed in.,5
It's simply the best -,"Shelter - a word sometimes used carelessly, without thought or consideration of its basic and true meaning. Where would we be without it? Do yourself a favor: stay at The Guesthouse on your next trip to Chicago. You'll be delighted at the small but unique gift shop in the lobby. You'll be treated like a cherished guest by the staff, and you won't believe how amazing the guest suites are! It's like walking into a beautifully appointed apartment. You'll notice the special touches. This is my third or fourth visit, and I'm still surprised how wonderful this thoughtful shelter really is. Surprised and grateful.",5
Hidden gem,"We stayed for a couple of nights in March 2017. We really loved the 2 BR/2BA apartment. It was clean, updated, and had everything that one would need for a one or multiple nights stay. The location worked perfect for us, as it was within walking distance of the Aragon Ballroom, where we were going to see a concert. There were plenty of restaurants and coffee shops close by as well.",5
Wife Birthday Trip,The hotel really is amazing. Great style and beautifully decorated. We got upgraded to a 3 BR and the amount of space was unbelievable. Everything is updated and modern and it was a great place to stay. Probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. And with the cost of public parking it was awesome to have a garage space! Especially when we got 6 inches of snow while we were there.,5
A Place to Call Home,"This is a lovely hotel. The staff is warm and inviting. The accommodations are top tier, and the beds are great, especially after an evening of dancing. Loved the lobby coffee service, and the local gifts made picking something up before we left to come home very easy. Not native to Chicago - but it seemed the hotel's location made it really easy to get around, and it is an easy walk up to Andersonville shops and restaurants.",4
Continued living like a local,"Our second visit - equally as enjoyable as the first! Enjoyed the accommodations, great staff and proximity to the local neighborhood. Andersonville is just up the street and filled with shops and great spots to grab a refreshment or meal.",5
Exceeded every expectation!,"I would 100% recommend The Guesthouse for anyone looking for an extended stay or even for a couple of nights. Gorgeous hotel, friendly staff and DOG FRIENDLY!",5
Peaceful refuge in Chicago,"The Guesthouse Hotel is an immaculate, peaceful, beautifully appointed hotel. The beds are very comfortable and the suites are very spacious. There are many great restaurants within a short walk (try Bar Roma for great Italian, especially their meatballs!) and there's a spa next door. Great value and very nice people. Though it's relatively small, someone is at the front desk 24/7. I highly recommend staying here.",5
Felt like home,"This hotel definitely made me feel at home, which was perfect for my wife and 1 year old. The service was great, and all of the staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was very nice, clean and very quiet. The location was also great in my opinion, it was far from the commotion of the city, but walking distance from a couple of places to eat.",5
Just Like Home,"I stayed at The Guest House for a business event. I rented the two -bedroom suite plus parking. It was great from start to finish. My room was clean and very comfortable. The space is perfectly arranged. There was a full service kitchen with microwave, fridge, dishwasher, and even a few glasses and dishes just bring your own wine cork tool :). Everyone was SUPER helpful in recommendations for local restaurants and entertainment. It seemed as though they really enjoyed their work. Even as shifts changed the entire staff is amazing. My only regret was not staying for the entire weekend. I will definitely visit again and hope to have the same great experience.",5
Amazing space-better than home!,"We enjoyed our stay in the 3 bedroom suite for 2 nights. We had a great experience and appreciated the accommodations made by the attentive staff at the guesthouse hotel. We hosted a staff retreat with out business coach and having a clean, beautiful and calming atmosphere made the most out of our planning retreat. The kitchen and living areas were great to save on eating out- and allowed us more time to plan. The bedrooms and bathrooms were luxurious. We highly recommend for any upcoming stay! Personal, business, out of town family. Thanks again!!",5
Unique Chicago Home-Like Stay,"I had my wedding in The Guest House hotel lobby in addition to staying at this lovely abode the weekend of my wedding. The whole staff was a pleasure to work with. They ensured everything was prepared for my ceremony in advance. They also made sure our stay was comfortable. Our room was immaculate and had a very home-like feeling to it. The whole place was stocked with plates, dishes, and anything you could ever need. It included all the life necessities which made for a very comfortable stay.",5
"I had the most enjoyable stay at the Guesshouse Hotel The amenities perfect the bedrooms are spacious the kitchen and living room area was fantastic I really enjoy the fire place,even a balcony so I can see the city The staff was very friendly and helpful and I can't wait to return to Chicago to stay there again!",,5
A great experience,"When I travel for vacations, I prefer to rent condos or houses. It was so nice to find a hotel that offers the condo living at hotel pricing and availability. The staff was super easy to work with and really seemed to care that our experience was perfect!",5
andersonville great spot,"Found this as a place that was close to The Green Mill, where we were seeing Jazz Legend Sheila Jordan that evening. It was a short walk past a scenic old cemetery to the club, and Andersonville had much to offer, in Coffee / Tea (La Colombe), dinner (Vincent) bakery (deFloured), and a terrific street vibe. We parked the car on arrival and walked everywhere.",5
Guesthouse Hotel,"This is a fabulous property. The room was outstanding, the employees bright and friendly, and the location was great. The price was good for a Chicago hotel and the optional parking was worth it. The Andersonville area is filled with restaurants and bars and is a good alternative to staying downtown. In summary, i would recommend this option without reservation.",5
"We took our toddler and his 2.5 year cousin, along with my sister and brother in law to a family wedding. The was the PERFECT place for everyone! The kitchen and furnishings were spectacular. The staff was amazing and made me feel welcome by touting my employer Zingerman's!!!",,5
Very spacious NEW condo size hotel!,"Stayed here at the NEW gueathouse hotel in Chicago with my girlfriend and parents. Good location about 10 minutes from the heart of downtown. Very modern with amazing space. All hardwood flors, balcony, fireplace and massive shower with a rainfall shower head in the middle and 2 more shower heads on each side. The street you stay on has at least 10 bars and restaurants to choose from. If those aren't your cup of tea downtown area is super close. There is free parking right down the street which is super nice to find in the city. If not you can pay $20 a night for a garage right behind the building. The only reason I do not give this hotel 5 stars is the hot water runs out quickly and if you do not stay on the top floor you can hear the people above you make every move in their room above you... Besides those 2 minor things this place is beautiful and makes you feel like your staying at your own home. Would deffiently stay here again!",4
"It was wonderful! Clean, convenient, all amenities are easy to use with well written instructions. Beautifully furnished with friendly staff. Enjoyed the stay very much.",,5
A perfect place to stay,"You won't find a better place to stay in Chicago. I promise you that. My wife and I traveled from Boston to visit my son and daughter-in-law and our new grandson. I wanted to be close to their home in Ravenswood. I thought The Guesthouse would be convenient. But, really, it's the nicest place I've ever stayed in Chicago. Far more comfortable than the typical Chicago business hotel. Infinitely nicer than the typical bed and breakfast. Rick, the general manager, is a great guy. Very hands-on. Very helpful and kind. He's a true gem. And so is his place.",5
Amazing!,This was our first vacation as a couple and so I wanted to do it right. Upon thorough research I discovered this place and the reviews were so amazing that I figured I might as well book it.,5
First Class gorgeous and cozy Hotel,"This was the first time I booked our team of 26-males in condo-type hotel rooms, they loved it! A great option if you are attending any sporting event at Loyola Chicago, only a 12 minute drive. The Guesthouse offered us spacious rooms equipped with everything; a courteous and helpful staff and a quaint neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. Mariano's grocery store is very close for grocery needs. We hope to return again soon so we can stay at the Guesthouse again!",5
Stayed here the night cubs won world series!,Very spacious room--actually it's a studio apartment. Would be great place for a longer stay. Complimentary coffee. Beautiful building. Friendly staff. Comfortable bed and nice furnishings. Not in the most convenient location but not too far either.,5
Fantastic Hotel,"I was going to a concert with friends at the Aragon Ballroom on 12/30 and we needed a place close to the venue to stay the night. We had a group of 6 and the two bedroom suite we booked at the Guesthouse ended up being impeccable. Fantastic staff, room and amenities. I was able to keep my car in a garage for a very reasonable rate with my own personal clicker which is a fantastic touch and took the worry of where to keep my car away. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone else and I myself will certainly stay there again.",5
You will feel like the owner of a luxury apartment in Chicago.,"We stayed in the three-bedroom suite and were AMAZED at how spacious and beautiful it was. It was wonderful to have a ""home"" to return to in Chicago -- complete with upscale kitchen, fireplace, dining area, and a master shower that became a steam room with the press of a button. We chose to park there as well, and were given a private garage with a garage remote. We also choose to attend afternoon tea during our stay, and loved the individual attention and delicious food. I cannot recommend this property more enthusiastically.",5
Loved our family stay,"We were 6 adults staying Thanksgiving week. It was our first trip to Chicago and friends had recommended several upper end hotels, however, I found Guesthouse on Trip Advisor. I debated with myself for days when I finally decided to give the Guesthouse a try. I'm SO glad I did! This was perfect for our family. We had a 2 bedroom/2 bath deluxe room. I had also reserved a 1 bedroom/1 bath and was pleasantly surprised to find we were upgraded to another 2 bed/2 bath. Our deluxe room had wood floors throughout, a gas fireplace, laundry room, large master suite w/walk-in closet, living area and kitchen. It was extremely spacious and the perfect place for our family of 6 to spend time together when we weren't out in the city. The kitchen was very well equipped and we were able to cook a very nice breakfast Thanksgiving morning. One of my favorite features was the shower in the master bath. There are multiple shower heads and steam. What a luxury and quite the treat in the cold weather we had. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the Andersonville neighborhood - all within walking distance. We were about 15 minutes from anywhere we wanted to go. There is on-site reserved parking in case you have a car which is a very nice feature. The staff at the front desk was always helpful and made great recommendations to us for shopping and eating out. I LOVED having my own apartment, especially since we were there for a week. I very much look forward to returning to Chicago and I wouldn't even look anywhere else. I will be back at The Guesthouse!",5
You wish your best friend or fondest relative treated you like this!,"Amazing! We have stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel off and on over many years and we have always enjoyed (not a strong enough word) our visits. The facilities and room are outstanding and the care and warmth of the management and staff are beyond expectations. We look forward to our visits there, not only because this location is convenient to the family we are visiting and EVERYTHING else in Chicago, but also because it feels like we are on a special vacation retreat. Excellent rooms, excellent staff service, special efforts to accommodate our extra needs to care for our dog and visiting toddlers, convenient location to great local food, shops, etc and greater Chicago locations and we always feel comfortable staying here.",5
wish we lived here!,"From the minute my wife and I walked into the Guesthouse Hotel, we felt at home. We kept saying to each other in amazement, this place is perfect! We wish we lived here! This hotel has thought of everything, and offers spacious, comfortable, very well-appointed ""rooms"" that are more akin to luxury apartments, but with all the benefits of a hotel. Notably, this includes the staff, who could not be nicer or friendlier. I wish the Guesthouse Hotel existed in my city---I would move in! Thank you for everything!",5
Beautiful place and great staff,"The guesthouse hotel is a beautiful place, centrally located and provide a great home away from home for our group of 7 ;) the staff was on top of any and all requests. Loved the steam shower and the robes were delightful (my husband wants one for xmas). Thank you for making our stay a pleasurable one!!!",5
You really CAN live like a local!,"Stayed four nights with our three year old daughter. Our 2BR/2BA suite was really a spacious modern apartment with full kitchen, full size washer and dryer, and even a gas grill on the balcony! Staff were all uniformly friendly and helpful. The bodega up the street was a great resource, as was the Mariano's Fresh just a mile or so away. This place is a fantastic value at around $200/night plus tax. We are planning our next stay soon. Do be aware, though, that you don't get daily maid service, there is no concierge, no restaurant on site, no bar. For us, this trade-off was a no-brainer: by staying here, driving 25 minutes in the morning, and paying $20 to park, we were able to attend our meetings at Rush and didn't pay $379/night for a two-queen room in a chain hotel in a sketchy neighborhood. All the comforts of home, and a bargain to boot!",5
Last minute stay,"I made a last minute decision to get a hotel room. I did not want to stay downtown as I usually do. I called them up and they had a few rooms left and had a special that was good for the area. Every employee I met during my visit did an excellent job. The room is really a two bedroom condo with two bathrooms, a washer/dryer, and a full kitchen...Parking was a real garage and they made room for my full size truck...",5
Siempre volver√≠a,"Alquilamos un apto para cinco personas, es un lugar muy limpio bien mantenido, bien puesto con facilidades para los visitantes , no es ruidoso , la cocina bien equipada. El lugar para dejar el coche de muy f√°cil acceso al dpto.",5
Beautiful stay in a lovely neighbourhood.,I stayed here with 2 other work colleagues. We were blown away at how wonderful the apartment suite was set up. We had plenty of room for each of us do our work and have time to ourselves after a long day of training. The staff was so helpful. Great little boutique in the lobby. I will come back with my family. So many neat shops and restaurants in the area to explore!,5
A great place to stay and feel like you are part of the neighborhood,"This was our first, (but definitely not our last) visit to the Guesthouse Hotel in Chicago. While this hotel is not near the loop or downtown, it is in a great northern Chicago neighborhood (Ravenswood) and is easy to reach all Chicago destinations via public transportation which is within walking distance. The hotel is immaculate and the rooms are spacious and have the feel of a fully furnished apartment, rather than a standard hotel room. The hotel is very quiet at night and easy to fall into a deep and restful sleep. All of the rooms in our suite were clean and ready for our three night stay. I could have easilty stayed for a month. The suites have fully furnished kitchens and laundry facilities, although we did not utilize them during our stay.",5
Amazing,"This place is top of the line. It is the definition of luxurious. If you're looking for a place to treat yourself, this is it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are willing to make any food or entertainment recommendations. The rooms are very spacious and clean. The design is very modern.",5

Outstanding,"Our stay here has been incredible !!! We could not possibly be more satisfied. Our two bedroom two bath suite was beautiful as is the entire place. The staff is welcoming,knowledgeable and friendly and the property is spotless. The neighborhood is safe and has incredible stores, boutiques, restaurants, and bars all within walking distance. The rooftop garden is wonderful and the views of the city are super. If your looking for the best of the best look no more ! Do yourself a favor and book one of their many luxury suites.... you can thank me later :) We are already planning our next trip back !!!!",5
Perfect for a family,The staff are friendly and thoughtful. I called the day before I arrived and asked about gluten free restaurants. They told me there were good choices and they had a list. I did not ask for the list but I received an email before my arrival with a breakdown and personalized review. I had a 3 bedroom and the space was huge. The apartment was spotless and well laid out. We tried several of the neighborhood restaurants and there were all good...and it is super nice to walk around. I would certainly stay here again.,5
Excellent facilities for large groups or families,"This is a great hotel/airbnb type place. No day to day maid service, and no room service. But in exchange, you get a spacious and elegantly appointed apartment, including a kitchen fully supplied with pots, pans, bowls, dishes etc. (Note that if you plan to cook, you will need to get virtually all spices, oils etc.) We had a 3 bedroom and it was very nice. The hallway bathroom had a deep jet tub. The master suite had a double headed shower plus a steam option. (Hard to keep my nephew out of there.) And with the size and privacy - we were able to flex and have friends stay over one night, as well as hosting family from Ohio for a couple of nights. Plus, the neighborhood is great. We lived in Andersonville in the early 2000s, and loved it then. It has slightly gentrified, which just translates into more restaurant options and a better wine store. We would stay here again without hesitation. My one nit/comment is that if you plan on working remotely, bring a device (hotspot, myfi etc) with you as the internet here cuts in and out and really can't support a link to a portal (which I have to work through). I was prepared for that, and brought two alternative wifi devices, so no issues. But the wifi worked fine for an ipad (including streaming), so should meet most needs.",5
Couldn't have asked for more,"I could not have imagined how great this hotel would be. The staff was just amazing. The room could not have been any better. I don't write reviews unless they are negative, until I stayed at Guesthouse Hotel. We were at this hotel for 4 nights, 5 days. I would not have changed a thing. Not just having a great room, but having a great staff. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and they really take their motto of live like a local seriously. Anything that you could want from a vacation to Chicago, is accessible from here, and the staff is always willing to give their, in my opinion, expert advise on how to get to where you want to go. If you stay anywhere in Chicago, I wouldn't stay anywhere else other than here. I will definitely be back.",5
Amazing Hotel,"Can't say enough about it! It's a beautiful boutique hotel with all the amenities you can ask for. The rooms are gorgeous, there is an amazing rooftop perfect for enjoying a cocktail, it's in a fun / local neighborhood with tons of restaurants within walking distance and you can easily get on the El if you want to head into the city. It's perfect for families and/or those who want more than one bedroom in their hotel.",5
The very best in accomodations,We recently stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel in Chicago. It is perhaps the nicest Boutique hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying at. We were upgraded at check-in to a huge two-bedroom unit. The apartment is enormous and beautiful in its,5
Best hotel experience,"I have stayed at many hotels in N. America and Europe for work and pleasure and this was my favorite experience so far. I wish I had gotten names of staff from recent stay (Oct 28-30, 2016) because the staff on our first night was truly exceptional. Our ""room"" was enormous, beautifully appointed and incredibly comfortable. We were in Chicago to enjoy the Cubs World Series for my boyfriend's birthday. We arrived too late Fri. For the goody bag give away that included a t-shirt, cookie and other Cubs swag but enjoyed the treats the hotel provided including wine and beer for a tailgate party. Hotel is in a great neighborhood north of Wrigley with easy access to public transportation and great restaurants. I cannot say enough good about this truly lovely hotel. A great bargain in a great spot with exceptional service. You won't be disappointed and I cannot wait to get back!",5
Live like a local & WALK TO WRIGLEY FIELD!!!,"We stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel last weekend. I can't say enough about this hotel! It was extremely clean and comfortable. Very well appointed. Our ""room"" was large, two bedrooms, two baths, full kitchen with a nice balcony & a gas grill. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooftop patio was a great place to enjoy a morning cup of coffee and look out over the city. The best part for us was that we were able to walk to Wrigley Field, it was a 15 minute walk and felt very safe. Also, the hotel is on the edge of Andersonville, so the Swedish Bakery was less than 5 minutes away. Giordanno's Pizza was across the street from the bakery so there was no shortage of Chicago dining! Great find on the north side of Chicago!!!",5
Gorgeous space. Cool Neighbourhood.,Gorgeous space and close to a cool neighbourhood. The apartments come with a full sized kitchen and are very spacious. The decor is elegant. The lobby staff are friendly. I'd definitely stay here again.,5
Peaceful stay,"I arrived here and was greeted by Jeremiahs(sp). He was very helpful about Chicago as it was my first time here. Later I met the GM who was just as gracious and warm. The hotel lobby provides a security entrance which I appreciated as well as guest parking garages. The lobby is very nicely decorated and the rooms truly reminds you of home. My room was clean and stocked with glassware, kitchen utensils, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop view as well. I also liked their snacks! Made with quality ingredients and they support their local Chicago grocers and businesses. The peace of mind I had staying here was priceless and I would highly recommend anyone to lodge here.",5
Extended Stay,We ended up at the Guesthouse for two weeks because of pervasive water damage to our condo. The Guesthouse was the only reasonable option that was dog friendly. So I thought it would be a reasonably nice place while we were going through a rough time. I was wrong...it was an incredible experience.,5
Not Just a Cubs' Game Visit,"Aside from The Guesthouse Hotel's superb and spacious room accommodations which left our group of 6 feeling at home with a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite, it has a great location. We love to visit Chicago to see a Cubs' ball game, enjoy the local food and simply experience the city and it's people. The Guesthouse location accommodated all our needs. The Guesthouse is located on a bus line that has a direct route to Wrigley Field. For evening entertainment, it is walking distance from a variety of restaurants offering several cuisines. While on a neighborhood walk one day, we encountered a community vegetable/herb garden and a local resident who was enthusiastic about sharing the particular details of the garden's operations.",5
Love this place!!!,"My husband and I came to Chicago for a Cubs game (Go Cubs!). We have been to Chicago several time and always stayed somewhere around Michigan Ave. We wanted to check out some new neighborhoods. This place is perfect for a family. We had a 2 bedroom (no one-bedrooms were available; my fault for waiting so long to book). The unit is basically an apartment. Very well appointed, 2 bathrooms, full kitchen with everything you need to make your own meals if you want to. There was access to the bus right in front of the hotel. The L was a few blocks away and it was very easy to get a taxi right out front of the hotel. Staff was very good about giving info on restaurants and things to do in the area. Very beautiful, peaceful place to stay. And roomier and cheaper than Michigan Ave.rooms and suites We will be back.",4
Great place for a family trip,"The 3 BR suite was luxurious, and lovely. It gave 4 of us plenty of space to get together and be apart. It is about 25 min ($18) by Lyft to the center of the town. Staff is great. Neighborhood is safe, but not scenic. Laundry machines are in the suites.",5
Way More Than Pet Friendly,"This hotel was too good for my dog! It is a beautiful property,impeccably maintained and with a staff that will do anything to make you comfortable. It is in the funky-cool little town of Andersonville with many unique restaurants. clubs and shops in walking distance. A treat bowl greets you and your pet in the lobby to the side of which is a very well-appointed sitting room where you can relax, watch TV and sip the fine coffee put out for you. The room is more like a nice apartment with full-size stainless appliances, and ceramic plates, cups, glass ware and flat ware. They had a very clean dog bed and bowls awaiting us when we entered the room. You can even park for free at the curb right in front of the hotel at night. The neighborhood is very safe. I LOVED this hotel and will be back to it when I visit my son at Loyola - with or without my dog.",5
Above and Beyond!,"We can't say enough good things about the staff at The Guesthouse Hotel. They went way beyond what we have experienced elsewhere in meeting the needs of my husband who has mobility challenges. They made sure we had everything we needed to make our weeklong stay comfortable and safe, including finding a suitable suite with a bed the right height, a bath with an adjustable shower head, and a suite with hallways wide enough to accommodate his wheelchair. And they did it all with good grace and humor. The suites are well equipped and nicely furnished with everything needed for a home away from home, including in suite laundry facilities and great take-out options when we didn't want to cook. The hotel itself is in a prime location in Andersonville for anyone needing a Northside location close to the Lake. We are hoping to return next spring and to bring one of our sons and his family. The only adjustment we would suggest is to install a wheelchair button on the rear doors to the parking area. The doors are very heavy and tend to swing closed, making it difficult to maneuver the wheelchair out to the parking lot. Other than that, The Guesthouse Hotel and its friendly staff get the highest of high marks!",5
Fabulous!,"We did a getaway weekend with very close friends but still wanted our privacy when it came to sleeping. This hotel (more like your personal condo) was the very best choice for us, as each of us had a two bedroom and bath but could still gather in each other's living rooms for a glass of wine or two after a long flight or a busy day sightseeing. We were on the same floor and unlike the long hallway usually found in hotels, our rooms were very close to one another because of the way these hotels are designed. Loved it! Also, super modern and sleek and clean.",5
Highly recommend staying here,"I stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel from mid-July until the end of August and had a wonderful experience here. The staff were incredibly friendly and it felt like home. I was studying for my medical boards and they made sure that I had a comfortable stay (and even helped celebrate when I received passing results!). With a great location, friendly staff and beautiful rooms (with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in in my life), it made my stay unforgettable. Thanks to everyone at the Guesthouse hotel!",5
Great stay at the Guesthouse,We travelled to Chicago for the Pearl Jam concerts at Wrigley Field and couldn't be happier with our stay. 3 couples plus an infant was very comfortable for all parties. The master bedroom was huge and had a massive bathroom. The Guesthouse now has a rooftop patio with a great view of the city. The staff was very accommodating and couldn't have been friendlier. The location is in a very unique neighbourhood close to many restaurants and shops. It is within walking distance (albeit a long one) to Wrigley (about 30 minutes) or a very cheap and quick cab away. Cab downtown ran us for about $25. Would recommend the Guesthouse to anyone and we are definitely hoping to get back someday! Thanks for a great stay!,5
Absolutely would stay here again...,"The Guesthouse Hotel was absolutely amazing! We stayed in a 3 bedroom condo along with two other couples and our young daughter. There was plenty of room and living space. We were travelling with our baby and appreciated that the hotel provided us with a pack and play, stroller, baby monitors, bathing kit, and a feeding kit. The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking and we took advantage of eating on both our balcony and the rooftop patio. The neighbourhood has many restaurants and shops and I felt perfectly safe taking early morning walks with my daughter. North Clark is a busy street so taxis were readily available and cost about $25 to downtown. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. On our last day, we checked out but were able to store our luggage at the hotel and borrow the stroller while we went on one last tour. I would not hesitate at all to stay here again in the future and recommend the Guesthouse to others.",5
"We loved our stay at The Guesthouse Hotel. Not only were the accommodation luxurious and cozy but thanks to all the child friendly details (travel cots, baby gym, bath toys, baby monitors, children's cutlery etc) our two little ones felt at home in an instant. We enjoyed our dinner on the roof terrace and all interaction with the super friendly staff.",We can only recommend this place - the best place to stay with a family in a great neighbourhood in Chicago. In walking distance to the red line and the metra if you'd like to explore further.,5
Wonderful hotel for a wedding party,"Our niece got married in an all-Andersonville affair. Family and friends were invited early to reserve at The Guesthouse Hotel. It was perfect, with flexibility for one, two or three bedrooms. The Guesthouse is close to downtown and near north neighborhoods so we loved the location. The apartments are beautiful. Well appointed and decorated. We had the good bye brunch in the lobby and on the rooftop deck, which was a perfect cap to a lovely weekend.",5
Much like a high-end condo...,"Stayed in Room 211 - spacious 3-bedroom, two bath, full kitchen - while attending son's wedding with Hallie Borden, owner of nearby Milk Handmade on N. Clark. Slept like a log. Entertained other family members also staying at The Guesthouse and other nearby rooms in our dining and living areas. Watched the Olympics on the large flat screen. Staff was attentive and accommodating, particularly when we ran a bit past departure time. Secure parking was a bonus. AND, we utilized the rooftop party areas with their terrific views of the Chicago skyline!",5
Very comfortable but...,"We stayed at the Guesthouse hotel for 3 nights and found it really comfortable and well equipped. We liked the location as well, because we like visiting local neighbourhoods not just follow tourist tracks. There is a lovely breakfast place nearby called Bongo Rooms which I'd recommend. All would be perfect if it weren't for the fact that, on the night before our departure we booked a taxi to the airport for the following morning and.....the person who was on Reception that evening simply forgot to book one!!!!!!!! We ended up booking and Uber which worked well but I just cannot understand how this could have happened...",4
second visit,i found the guest house to be just as delightful a place to stay the second time as i had the first. the staff are very efficient and cordial. they are available but not intrusive during your stay.,5
Always a pleasant stay!,"We stay at the Guesthouse Hotel whenever we visit our family in Chicago and it's always amazing. We have stayed with our toddler, groups of family and friends, and alone as a couple. The staff is accommodating and friendly, the rooms are clean and well-stocked, and the location is convenient to all that we are looking for. Overall, one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had, and consistently so.",5
Wonderful Hidden Gem!,"We booked this property for three nights and were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a 2 BR/2Bath apartment! They also provided secure, garaged parking with an electric vehicle charging station. Staff was customer focused and helpful with recommendations for food and entertainment options. Although we didn't take advantage of the fully stocked kitchen, if you want to do cooking or grilling, they have the equipment you'll need. Extended stay options here make this an excellent choice for longer term accommodations as well. We would definitely stay at The Guesthouse Hotel again!",5
A Home Away From Home in Chicago,"I was tasked with planning a reunion in Chicago with three sorority sisters. We hadn't all been together in eight years, so we had a lot of catching up to do. Separate hotel rooms with no place to congregate just wouldn't do, so I was thrilled to find The GuestHouse Hotel, which offered three bedroom, two bath luxury condominium accommodations, with a gorgeous great room area where we could comfortably chat, cook, and share a meal at all hours of the day and night.",5
Another reason to LOVE Chicago,You might not care that my name is Benjamin Eckstein...,5
"""Live like a local"" in an up-and-coming Chicago hood","I booked the Guesthouse for a 3 day mid-week stay, hoping to experience Chicago for the 1st time as a local and it exceeded my expectations. The unit looks to have been built as a high-end condo and converted into a hotel that reminded me of the intersection of AKA Hotels and London's Soho Hotel. Beautifully appointed, modern, but with a cozy feeling.",5
Perfect!,"I had a wonderful stay! It was so beautiful there and quite easy to get around town and find great things to do walking distance! I would highly recommend! I had the 2 bedroom suite and went with a friend. We loved the privacy, location and quality of the space. Everything seemed top notch and stellar customer service as well.",5
live like a local!,"The hotel is just as pictured! It is more of a condo, and has everything you need for a short or long stay. But it also functions as a great hotel. Room service can be requested. There is a great spa right next door that offers in room massage. We had breakfast rolls delivered right to our door from a delicious local bakery. Great location in Andersonville, with easy access to trains. Many great restaurants within walking distance to hotel as well. Bought some great locally made skin products right in the lobby. There is also a little ""pantry"" area in the lobby with delicious snacks. Highly recommend this ""locally grown"" guest house! Oh, and the decor is just yummy! Will be back a lot to visit our collage student son, and this will be the perfect place to land every time!",5
One word: Amazing! I won't stay anywhere else in Chicago from now on!,,5
"Great Location, Beautiful Hotel","The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our suite was spotless and provided everything we needed, including quiet, away from busy Clark Street. Parking garage!! Thank you! Andersonville is a really fun spot, and we couldn't have picked a better place to hang our hats for the weekend.",5
Extremely nice staff and room provisions,"All of the staff there was extremely nice. I accidentally left my purse in the unit and the staff did everything that they could to get it back to me, including Googling and emailing me (because my phone was in the purse). Additionally, the rooms were extremely nice and very well equipped with dishware, toiletries and anything else that we could need. It was also the only hotel that I could find in Ravenswood, where I was looking for apartments. It is a little far from downtown Chicago if that is where you are looking to stay though.",5
No need to stay downtown,"We recently stayed at the Guesthouse for our daughter's graduation from LUC. We had 6 people in a 3 bedroom/2bath condo. The unit was spacious, perfectly clean and decorated. It was a great place to gather with our daughter's friends and their parents. If we had been in a hotel, the entire weekend would have been different.",5
Great location; comfortable apartment living,"We stayed at the Guesthouse while visiting our daughter in Chicago, since it was an easy walk to her north-side apartment as well as close to public transportation. The Guesthouse was like having our own apartment for the week. Our suite was well equipped with a kitchen and washer/dryer, as well as a huge, comfortable bed & nice bathroom. The kitchen, living area & balcony with a grill allowed us to cook and enjoy a home-style family meal together as well as enjoying our morning coffee. Our 1 bedroom suite was quiet at night and well climate controlled for the changing spring temperatures--79 degrees one day and low 60s the next. They graciously lent us an umbrella for a rainy day and stored our luggage after check out so we could explore more of the Andersonville neighborhood before an evening flight home. We enjoyed staying in the city with all the comforts of home in a perfect location and will hope to return to The Guesthouse again when we're in Chicago.",5
Personal Visit,"Just wanted to say that this comfortable and meticulously cared for property off the regular beat and path of Chicago's downtown area was a surprise gem. I had a 2 bedroom apartment that felt more like a home then a hotel. Beds, linens and pillows were all very comfortable.",5
Home away from home,"Located in the Andersonville neighborhood, the Guesthouse Hotel is ideal for a traveler who desires a home-like base for his or her visit. The suites were clearly designed as apartments with the amenities of such: a kitchen supplied with dishes and cooking utensils and a washer and dryer, I found the place especially attractive since I was visiting family in Andersonville. For someone more interested in the downtown area of Chicago there are el stops within a few minutes' walk. While it may be a bit pricey for a single person, for a family or small group it is actually rather economical.",5
Wish they had these in EVERY city!,"Stayed at the Guesthouse hotel for four days this week on a girlfriend trip to Chicago. Truly, we were flabbergasted that all of the glowing reviews were spot on. We rented both a 2 bedroom and a 3 bedroom apartment so we each had our own bedroom and only two people had to share a bathroom. It worked out to about $800 per person which is not cheap, but all thought it was totally worth it. Not to mention that they had the BEST chocolate covered pretzels at the desk lobby.",5
We enjoyed our vacations in this place.Very beautiful apartment .We feeled like at home .It was so plesant to live there.Nice people too .Thank you,,5
Incredible Family Weekend,"My mom, sister and 16-mth nephew stayed here last month for my bridal shower. It was an unbelievable experience in hospitality. The space is welcoming, and comfortable. Every need has been thought-through..especially those often overlooked, such as the needs when traveling with a toddler. It felt like our family as a whole was cared for top to bottom. Our whole family is staying again for the week of my wedding and everyone can't stop talking about how amazing the space is. It feels luxurious, but not stuffy at all. The balconies are HUGE. It felt like a home away from home, where all our familial needs that normally become burdensome were met...we're so grateful and such huge fans of this business. I don't have enough great things to say!",5
Mixed emotions,No better place to stay on the north side of Chicago cause basically there are no hotels!,4
Fantastic Hotel!,We really enjoyed staying at The Guesthouse Hotel last week. The owner upgraded our room to a larger apartment and it was really comfortable. They provided us really good coffee. The location is excellent. The bus took us everywhere. We took brown train to downtown and we took Metra to the fantastic Chicago Botanical Garden. You don't need a car to enjoy all the best of Chicago from this hotel. We will definitely come back! Thank you!,5
Sisters weekend in Chicago,"The Guesthouse was a perfect spot for our mother/sisters' weekend in Chicago. The amenities were great and the 2BR/2Bath apartment was awesome. It was really nice to wake up in the morning to our own spot for coffee and breakfast and later in the day for hanging out prior to our evening event. Lots of time to catch up! Andersonville is a fun neighborhood with boutique shopping and good local restaurants. If you want to stock up in your kitchen when you go, Mariano's Grocery store - a 15 minute walk - is the best!",5
Truly a home away from home,"We stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel during a 5-week home renovation, and we could not have asked for a better home away from home! The hotel is chic, positioned very close to a few of Chicago's best neighborhoods (Andersonville, Ravenswood, Lincoln Square), close to amazing food, close to the beach...the list goes on and on. Most of all, it was comfortable and enabled us to smoothly transition from one home to the next. It is rare in Chicago to find someplace fully furnished - that really is FULLY furnished. There was never anything we needed - they even had a crib we used. It was a terrific experience, all around.",5
We loved our stay here! Our two bedroom suite was just perfect!,,5
Much better deal than you would think!,"Booked in here for 3 nights. THEN read the info about the hotel. Thought I couldnt afford the luxury but it wasn't much more (or maybe less) than a ROOM downtown. And it was a 2 bdrm apt, fully equipped, including washer and dryer. What a great place to stay!",5
Spectacular for space and at home feel!,"We stayed in a three bedroom unit for Spring Break. It was excellent! Minutes from lakeshore drive and close enough to every where we wanted to go. We did bring our own vehicle so that we could get to places. A definite place to stay if you want top accommodations, private bedrooms etc. I am so over small hotel rooms!",5
Oscar Weekend at the Guesthouse,"I had the best weekend at the Guesthouse! I was looking for a hotel with a kitchen to host an Oscar Party with my grown children who live in the area. Boy, did I hit the jackpot!!! Two bedrooms, fabulous kitchen, large living room with gas fireplace, supreme service and everything we needed include a spectacular grocery store down the street! We had so much fun hanging out in ""my apartment"" and instantly got cabs out front for our other activities. The lobby at the Guesthouse is equally comfortable and beautiful. Can't wait for my next visit.",5
Beautiful hotel,We stayed in the 3 bedroom unit. It was better than a traditional hotel. The staff was awesome. We were in town for our daughters wedding. It had all the amenities we needed for the long weekend. We loved that we could walk to restaurants too.,5
The Guest House truly lets you feel,"like you live in Chicago while you are here, only better! The apartments are beautiful and spacious with tasteful furnishings, high ceilings and lots of light. The staff is friendly and helpful and the lobby is a wonderful place to relax and have a complimentary cup of coffee or hot chocolate after a day of running around Chicago. The neighborhood, Andersonville, is very special-- with lots of shops, restaurants and easy access to the rest of the city. I felt so at home here this weekend that I gave a brunch for 16 local friends. And the Guest House made sure I had extra chairs and silverware. What a s",5
Back again!,"I have stayed at The Guesthouse on several occasions. It is always clean and beautifully furnished! This time my 1 year old granddaughter came along. The staff went out of their way to accommodate all her needs. They provided a crib, high chair and eating kit plus offered a list of other items - all complimentary!! We will be back!",5
Stunning,"Really loved this hotel right from the get-go. Stunning lobby, Super helpful staff. It has big, bright, well stocked suites. Close enough to andersonville to walk, but far enough to not be in the thick of it.",5
"Great Place, Great Experience!","I was upgraded to a 2 bed/2 bath suite. The place was amazing!! Beautiful and clean apartment complete with balcony, grill, and laundry. The staff was unbelievably accommodating and caring during my stay. I would come back here in a second.",5
Wonderful home away from home,"This was our second visit to the Guesthouse Hotel and once again it proved to be a wonderful place for a family gathering. Well stocked, fully equipped kitchen that was great for preparing holiday meals for our extended family. Comfortable, spacious rooms. This time, the sleep sofa had a very comfortable memory foam mattress (much better than our prior experience). Considering all the space and high end feeling, this is quite an affordable option versus staying in a more traditional hotel. Friendly staff, and dog friendly. Highly recommended.",5
Great experience!,"I had to go to Chicago for a funeral. Several of my family members needed rooms. I don't know how I stumbled on this place, but it was such a god send! I was traveling with my 11 month old baby and they gave me everything I needed for her, even a digital baby monitor! Everyone in our party loved how nice the rooms were and the staff could not have been more helpful!",5
Perfect Place for a Chicago Experience,"The facilities are clean, well maintained, and there is a 9 p.m. - 9 a.m. quiet rule that really helped this to be a perfect place to crash after a busy day out and about. The parking facilities are well worth the extra money--especially since there is no nearby alternative (all pay and park on Clark). The staff are all very friendly and helpful and even put away the perishable groceries I had delivered there before we arrived. The one thing that was only a little inconvenient is that there are no phones in the apartments, so there's no way to contact the main desk.",5
Wonderful place to stay.,"Every aspect of this hotel is excellent. The accommodations are neat.clean,stylish and very comfortable. The hotel staff is very professional and goes the extra mile to make everyone comfortable. The location is at the edge of Andersonville which has excellent food and shopping in a great neighborhood setting. Public transportation is very close: bus stop on the corner, red line within walking distance, taxis always available.",5
Live like a Local in the Windy City,"Spacious, modern, clean, with full kitchen, laundry and all of the niceties of a comfy home including a balcony with a great view. Located in the North Side of Chicago in a neighborhood with much to do within walking or driving distance. . The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.",5
"Our daughter, Carlene, brought us to Chicago for our 25th Anniversary, she set us up in the Guest House Hotel and I have to say I have never stayed anywhere that was so completely AWESOME. The whole stay in Chicago was a trip we will never forget.",,5
Thanksgiving,"Once again I had the pleasure of staying at the Guesthouse Hotel. I found it in the first place because it is convenient to family I visit in Chicago. I can make meals in the completely equipped kitchen. My grandson can spread out his toys and games when he spends time with me. I think this facility offers much for visitors who are at ease with public transit because bus stops are steps away from the door, and it is listed on Uber. The staff is knowledgeable about the neighborhood as well as the city at large. It is a relaxing place to return to after a busy day. I recommend it for families and long stay business travelers because it feels, when I come back, that I am coming to a second home.",5
We were welcomed home.,"We needed a last minute reservation after another place disappointed, we were in a bit of a hurry to get to dinner and a concert. When I called the Guesthouse Hotel and told the receptionist of our plight, she simply said, ""we have a room for you, of course/ Just get here and we will handle all the details then."" What a relief! When we approached the door, my friend and I laughed with delight at the welcoming effect of the foyer and lobby! We were taken care of with great caring, felt like we were family. Our suite was so beautiful and bright and we actually considered cancelling our reservations and ordering in so that we wouldn't have to leave! Every aspect of the stay was delightful and we will be back, hopefully many times. Thank you for al that made our stay so wonderful.",5
Neighborhood Gem,"We chose this hotel because we have family that lives in the area. What a find! The hotel room has everything you need from a full kitchen with high end appliances to a washer and dryer in unit. There was even a small balcony with a grill. We only stayed one night but this would be a perfect place to stay if you had to be in Chicago for an extended period. It was easy to host our family that we were visiting in our hotel room because you had everything you needed. The neighborhood is great, there are many good restaurants and bars within walking distance. We usually stay downtown when we visit but it was nice to be so close to our family. When you stay here you feel like you're living like a local.",5
Topnotch boutique hotel!,"There was nothing about this hotel that wasn't topnotch! From the inviting lobby, the helpful staff, the clean and luxurious suite, the private garage. We were visiting folks living on the North Side and chose this hotel for the location, amenities, garage, and especially, the reasonable price. I've stayed in much pricier hotels that could/should take lessons from The Guesthouse. After our departure, we discovered we left something behind. In short order, the staff retrieved our belongings and offered to ship it back home, too. Without a doubt, this is the place to stay!",5
A Great Choice,"We really liked everything about this hotel. It was very clean, well-appointed and reasonably priced. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. In addition, there are many great restaurants and bars a very comfortable walk away from the hotel. I would gladly stay there again.",5
Loved it! Beautiful! Great location! Loved the gift shop! Affordable and local products!,,5
"Lovely, clean, and beautifully appointed",Just arrived to The Guesthouse Hotel. The one bedroom suite is spacious and clean. The hotel staff is very accommodating and helpful. The property is tastefully decorated and very lovely. The kitchen in the room has very nice appliances and everything you need if you want to cook a meal. Very nice place to stay if you don't need to be in the downtown area. Would definitely stay here again.,5
Great Location,We recently stayed at the Guest House while visiting the Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago. What a welcoming and comfortable place! The unique atmosphere fits right in to the wonderful community of Andersonville. It is easy to walk to restaraunts and sights in the area and bus/train are easily accessible for getting to other parts of Chicago. The Guest House is a very welcome change from typical hotel and bed/breakfast accommodations. We will have reasons to return to Andersonville and look forward to staying at The Guest House again and again.,5
"The Guesthouse is the perfect home away from home. We lived here for a little over a month while our house was been rehabbed after a fire. When your life is in dissary, it is nice to be at a place where the little things are taken care of quickly and professionally. Rick, Rosemary, Sarah and the rest of the staff were fantastic caretakers. Always pleasant and willing to help. The location is fantastic! Located in Andersonville, North of downtown, it's perfect for when you want to go to a cubs game (just hop on the bus) or you want stay in the city and not be downtown and still be close enough to be downtown in 15 minutes. I recommend to anyone who needs relocation housing, insurance housing, or a hotel in the city that's not downtown to stay at The Guesthouse Hotel!",,5
"A great 4 day weekend in a very outstanding, comfortable, great setting in Chicago!","Everything was lovely plus!!! The lobby and entryway were so cozy and inviting, the parking so safe, close and well lit. The unit itself - just outstanding. Bright, comfy, roomy, with everything you could ever need included there for you. We just loved it!",5
"Es llegar y sentirte mejor que en casa. La atenci√≥n, el olor al caf√©",,5
Great Place!,"My wife and I and five kids stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel for four nights in October. It was great. We travel quite a bit and I am picky about lodging...and this place was better than anywhere we have stayed. We had a 3BR suite - plenty of space, very clean, etc. Andersonville was wonderful with lots of neat shops, restaurants, etc. We spent a lot of time exploring on North Clark Street. It is an easy walk to the train and quick ride into downtown...but it was so nice to come back to The Guesthouse Hotel (and Andersonville) at the end of the day. Also, the staff was extremely helpful before and during our stay - including answering all of my questions and having a pack and play and high chair available for us. Overall, I can't say enough good things about The Guesthouse Hotel. We are already planning our next visit - this time with some other couples to further explore the area and see a Cubs game (Wrigley Field is a couple miles away and was an easy walk).",5
Living like a local,"Spent a long October weekend at the Guesthouse Hotel - what a delight!! A quick walk to local shops and restaurant scene, refreshments on the rooftop deck, easy access to the train if needed, and great accommodations and attentive staff. A repeat performance is definitely in order.",5
Great place to stay in Chicago. Close to the train and close to Wrigley.,,5
Nice Place!,This place is the best. We got a two room suite and it came with a roof top lounge.,5
It was good . Neat & clean with all accessories .pleasure to stay there. Staff was cooperative .,,4
Former colonies in chicago,We stayed at the Guesthouse with a total of 8 people and had a great time. The condo was awesome and the kitchen allowed us to cook many of our meals. Several of the members of our group have traveled extensively and we're all impressed. The front desk staff was also very prompt and helpful in answering questions both via email and in person.,5
Magical Wedding Weekend in Chicago,My Daughter got Married in Chicago on October 10....My family took 3 Condo's in the Guesthouse. It was perfect. The hotel staff was very helpful.....We had plenty of room to sleep Aunts and uncles and cousins and Grandma....everyone had a room. My daughter and her bridesmaids had plenty of room for Hair and makeup. We stocked the fridge and the bar and we felt like we were right at home. I would highly reccomend the Guesthouse for your next weekend event in Chicago!,5
"""First Choice"" for us!",Lloyd & Betty M,5
Wonderful Home Away From Home,"We were thrilled with the friendliness and ease of staying at the Guesthouse Hotel. We have stayed in many hotels around the city, but this place felt like home. The service was excellent and felt friendly and helpful. We stayed because it was close to the Kiss Kiss Cabaret - we were within an easy walking distance of it and several other entertainment venues. It was nice to be out of the noise and commotion of downtown and yet it was very easy to get downtown with the wonderful transit system in Chicago. We spent the weekend exploring the whole city but enjoyed being able to come back to ""our home away from home"".",5
Beautiful Place to Stay Outside of Downtown Chicago,"My husband and I were going to a concert at Wrigley Field and we have stayed downtown in the past but wanted to try something different and not be downtown - something less hectic and easier to get around so it wasn't easy, but I found The Guesthouse. I was a little nervous about it because there weren't a lot of reviews and it didn't pop up right away when I did a search. Also, everything within miles of Wrigley Field was booked so I worried a little that I could easily get a room. But I was so pleasantly surprised. It was easy to get to from O'Hare and so beautiful. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment and it looked brand new. Everything was in perfect condition and cleaner than I ever would have expected. It was pretty, bright and very roomy. There were two bedrooms, two bathrooms, washer/dryer, well stocked kitchen, living area and a nice deck with a grill. The bed was extremely comfortable and there were quiet hours between 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. which was great - we didn't hear a thing. The front desk staff was very helpful in suggesting how to get around and places to go. There is also a very nice binder in the room which has resources for restaurants, things to do, grocery shopping, etc. Groceries and ready to cook meals, along with take out food can easily be delivered to the room. The bus goes right by the hotel and getting to Wrigley Field took 10 minutes. This would be a wonderful place to stay with two couples or a family with children. Another great thing is that dogs are not only accepted, but welcome. I would recommend getting a parking pass for $20 per day. There is an assigned parking garage in the back of the building which was so convenient and safe. Rooms at the front of the building look out over a cemetery and street and rooms in the back look over the alley and garages.",5
Great Boutique Hotel,We live south of the city but stayed here for one night after a concert at Wrigley Field. I was shocked to find such a nice place in the area. It is about a mile and a half to Wrigley. We cabbed it down and then decided to walk back afterwards. The neighborhood was safe and we stopped to grab food too.,5
Nice stay in Chicago,Stayed there for three nights with family. Really nice place and provides everything you need for a relaxed stay. Coffee was nice but I wish they provided good English tea bags. Sarah at front desk is a charming lady with information about local area. Parking is available in proper lockable garage at very reasonable rate.,5
Great hotel,"Enormous, well appointed space. Balcony space (except it is across the street from a cemetery-the only down side), comfortable beds, full kitchen & lovely furnishings. They have a very Friendly staff with knowledge of the Low key neighborhood. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5
fabulous!,My little dog and I had a marvelous experience at the guesthouse. not only was the staff friendly and helpful-they truly were welcoming to my pet. the suites have beautiful wood floors that makes any necessary cleanup easy. the decor is simple but tasteful and most comfortable. in fact i would say that was the most comfortable hotel bed i've ever slept in right down to the pillows. i have zero complaints and i stayed four nights.,5
Boutique hotel and modern condo - Best of both worlds,"Their motto is ""live like a local"" and it is very appropriate. With a full kitchen, gas grill and lots of room, a family could easily take all of their meals here. That would be a mistake. Andersonville shops are just two blocks away, and include some of the best restaurants in Chicago. The hotel was a $40 cab ride from Midway Airport, and its a short cab or Uber drive to any of Chicago's attractions. A car is unnecessary, but they do maintain a small parking lot where you can park a vehicle for $20 a night. The two bedroom suite comfortably accomodates four guests and can handle up to six if you pull out the sleep sofa. They do not have daily housekeeping, but there is plenty of linen available and i actually enjoyed not having a maid in the room. The rooms were immaculate when we checked in. There were many luxury touches including a beautiful lobby, library, and heavy after shower robes. We loved our stay and have already made reservations for a wedding and mini family reunion this fall. If you're tired of downtown hotels and would like a more intimate visit to Chicago, this is the hotel for you.",5
"Great ""home away from home"" for a family reunion visit.","We were in town to visit family who lived in this part of Chicago, and other family members were coming from various other locations as well. Our 3-Bedroom unit was huge, with a fully equipped kitchen, balcony with a gas grill, ample seating areas for dining and hanging out, and spacious bedrooms. It is essentially a 3-bedroom condo unit that is offered on a highly basis, and good value given all you get versus a hotel room elsewhere.",5
Fantastic!,"Like other reviewers have said, this was really a home away from home. Friendly, welcoming and warm staff from start to finish, beautiful and comfortable suites. Wish we could have stayed longer. This is what a guesthouse should be and so much more. Highly recommend.",5
Wonderful hotel,"What a find. Tucked inconspicuously along Clark is a lovely hotel that was recommended by a relative because of proximity to them. We found it to surpass any hotel we've visited in Chicago by a large gap. The staff is marvelous, the rooms spacious, clean, well stocked...did I mention spacious? They are designed for people (who like real space) small groups and have kitchens, several rooms..new facilities. I could rave more but won't except to mention that the nearby Andersonville neighborhood is a delight with small shops, restaurants and a Swedish Museum.",5
Wonderful Accommodations!,"Five girlfriends and I stayed here for a Chicago girls weekend trip. We really enjoyed this hotel! We shared a three bedroom suite, and having the large kitchen and living area gave us plenty of room to spread out. Andersonville had wonderful restaurants and shopping - all within easy walking distance of the hotel. People should be aware, though, that the walk to the train is a little further than we had hoped (maybe 1 mile or so) - but it was completely manageable to walk to/from the train and was a quick trip into the city. I highly recommend this hotel.",5
AWESOME,"Very nice hotel and Great staff. Lots to do locally & downtown. Chicago transit system is very convenient, no car needed. Had family get together with my grandchildren from California & Il for the Cubs ~ Giants weekend. Great fans, food and memories. Would highly recomend the Guest Hotel. Thank you very much. Hope to see you soon.",5
AMAZING!!!,"Absolutely AMAZING hotel & staff. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for my first trip to Chicago. The Guesthouse Hotel has such a warm and inviting atmosphere and the hotel lobby boutique is so charming. They really work hard in making it feel like a home away from home. It is also conveniently located near the red line and not far from downtown Chi. Thank You Guesthouse for making my stay so wonderful, I loved it!!!!",5
Wonderful location for mini-family reunion!,"My brother had informed me about this relatively new hotel that had opened in his neighborhood and since I had been searching for the ideal location for my husband and me, my daughter and 2 grandsons that we would be picking up from music camp in Indiana for a 3-day stay in Chicago, The Guesthouse proved to be a wonderful choice. Unfortunately, a sudden illness prevented me from going but my husband (who had originally been reluctant to be so far from downtown) raved about it as did the rest of our family. The accommodations were more than ample to invite 9 additional adults and 2 children to have the reunion at The Guesthouse and they were very impressed. If you're coming to Chicago and don't need to be downtown, this is an excellent place. It is roomy, full kitchen, even a washer and dryer in the room. I would not hesitate recommending The Guesthouse especially if you need separate bedrooms. My only regret is that I missed the opportunity for myself but I will definitely make reservations when I have the chance to visit Chicago again.",5
Ideal location for a retreat with family and friends,"Last Thursday, our family of four met in Chicago for a spur of the moment ""family retreat."" We wanted a clean, attractive place to enjoy one another's company while deciding where to go for food and fun, preferably within walking distance. I cannot imagine anything better for this purpose than the Guesthouse Hotel. For three nights, we enjoyed a spotless, bright, beautifully furnished two-bedroom, two bath apartment with a full kitchen and large living quarters with washer/dryer. Excellent beds and linens, everything in working order, a closet full of extra towels, darn good coffee ready to brew. We walked down Lawrence to the organic, natural foods and gourmet grocery for provisions, two blocks down Clark to Chicago's hip restaurant scene for mussels and fries, to the train for forays downtown. Sincere thanks and best wishes to the kind and courteous staff who made us feel at home. Did I say that we grilled freshly caught white fish from Lake Superior on our balcony? No hesitations, we highly recommend this establishment.",5
Wish we could've stayed longer!!!,"We had a great stay at The Guesthouse Hotel. We had two families with ten people and stayed in the 3 bedroom suite. It was beautiful and very spacious to accommodate all of us. Lots of room for 6 boys to ""hang out"". Great little neighborhood. Make sure to eat breakfast at the Bongo Room. Best breakfast in Chicago!!",5
"Wonderful area of Chicago, lots of space","Andersonville is a great, quirky area north of downtown. Our 3 bedroom apartment was spacious and well equipped. Their motto is ""Live like a local"" and that is true if you are a fabulously wealthy local. I mean to say it is upscale. Only downside is that, unlike a regular hotel, each condo has its own hot water supply, which means if you are housing six you will run out of hot water. Also, no towel exchange but there is a washer dryer to wash the towels yourself. You also have to tote your trash to the curb yourself, but this is good because who wants trash bags in the hall. All in all a very nice stay for a family wedding.",4
Lovely stay!!,"My husband and I and another couple were extremely pleased with our stay at The Guesthouse Hotel. We stayed in a spacious, very clean, ground floor two bedroom, two bath condo. The condo was well-stocked with everything needed for our stay- fluffy towels in the bathrooms and full kitchen with glassware, cookware, coffeemaker. Additionally, our room had a small patio which was adjacent to the parking lot. Even though the view wasn't spectacular, we enjoyed having our morning coffee outside on the cool mornings. Rick and all the staff were quite friendly and extremely helpful with anything we needed!! All we had to do was ask! The hotel is centrally located for Chicago's public transportation. No need for a car!! Be sure to visit the wonderful restaurants along N. Clark and the charming Andersonville area near the hotel. We have already recommended The Guesthouse Hotel to friends visiting the Chicago area in August. We can't wait to go back ourselves!!",5
"Everything is first class, including the service and attitude.","We were very pleased and enthused by how nice all of the features and service by the staff made our stay perfect. All is first class, without a hitch. There was not anything that I would change. The cleanliness was top-notch, as was the quality of all of the furnishing and fixtures. The steam shower was a pleasant surprise.",5
Great place for the whole family!,We spent four nights in flat 410 - a two bedroom two bath with plenty of room for two adults and two teens. The room backs onto the alley and was very quiet. It was also spotless. The secure parking and the washer/dryer were bonuses. We followed the front desk's suggestion of the Bongo Room for breakfast. Delicious! Short walk to several good restaurants.,5
Great place for families,"We totally enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel. The apartment was very tastefully furnished and the fully equipped and stylish kitchen made it easy to feel at home. We enjoyed the spacious rooms and modern bathrooms as well as the possibility to sit outside on a balcony after a long day of sightseeing. If we get the chance to visit Chicago again, we will definitely try to come back!",5
Trip to Wrigley - Royals/Cubs,"The Guesthouse Hotel was perfect for our trip from KC to Wrigley Field. We rented a 3BR unit as we had 3 adult couples -- our stay was absolutely perfect. Property is clean, people are very nice and all of us being able to stay in the same place was very convenient. We used the bus to get to Wrigley which is pretty user friendly, with the ability to text and receive bus arrival times, and the Red Line from Wrigley to Downtown -- all in all, about 20 minutes. I highly recommend The Guesthouse Hotel and we will absolutely stay there again!!!!!",5
Nice facility in a not so nice neighborhood,"I booked here because I am a Select Registry Fan. When we drove in my son, who lives in Chicago, asked me if I was sure I wanted to stay. I had already paid so gave it a try. I would definitely not stay here again as a single woman. Very uncomfortable driving back at night and the rat I ran over did not help. ( I guess I did not help the rat either). I realize rats do exist in cities as I am a New Yorker, but still not nice. As far as the room, it was attractive but no bath tub in the tiny bathroom and no shelf for personal items. Nice robes, nice kitchen and pleasant staff. Someone did come in my room when I was out and did not firmly close the door. Nothing was taken, but gave me a fright when I came back. There is no place to eat on the premises. Despite my rating I would not go back. The neighborhood, lack of tub, and lack of breakfast were deal breakers for me.",4
Just perfect!,"From check-in to check-out it was all ""just perfect!"" We stayed 4 days and fell in love with our 3bd, 2ba suite. The suite was well appointed and very comfortable. If we had a question the staff was quick to respond. Plenty of food, shopping and live music options all within walking distance. Wrigley was a little far for us but the bus was easy and Uber was always available as were cabs. We can't wait to stay at the guesthouse again! Neighborhood was very safe. Walked it all times of day and never had a concern.",5
Second visit better than the first,"We stayed at The Guesthouse a year ago, just as they were opening, and we couldn't think of a better place to stay when we returned to Chicago a year later.",5
Best place in Chicago,"Totally love this place! A home away from home. Full kitchen, plenty of room for the whole family.",5
"The Guesthouse Hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff amazing. They truly worked diligently to accommodate our needs as we had an unexpected delay during our mini-vacation. The area itself was quaint and very entertaining, such that we did not feel the need to head into the downtown area. Delicious food, great shops and honestly their slogan says it all...we felt like locals and enjoyed every minute! We can not wait to return!",,5
The perfect place for our family and friends,"The Guesthouse Hotel is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù hotel when our out-of-town family members need a place to stay and want to live like a local. The rooms are unbelievably spacious and clean, with all the amenities one could reasonably want. Further, the staff really goes the extra mile to make sure that everyone enjoys their stay. We recently had our daughter‚Äôs high school graduation party in the library and fireplace section of the lobby. It was perfect and intimate, and we received lots of compliments on the venue. This place is a real find.",5
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.","We were three couples, two sharing a two bedroom suite and the other a one bedroom suite. The accommodations were comfortable, spacious and fully equipped. This allowed us to have everyone including our daughter and her family to enjoy a dinner together in the two bedroom suite. We took dull advantage of the neighborhood: shopping at the bakery and convenience store nearby, eating at local restaurants and walking up Clark Street to attend the street festival. The staff was attentive and great. I would definitely stay here on out next visit to Chicago.",5
Had a great stay,3 of us shared a 3 bedroom suite. Plus I brought my dog. It's all exactly like the website. It was a perfect stay.,5
"While I've not been able, yet, to place a client at The Guesthouse Hotel, if you are wanting a fabulous place to spend a weekend, a week or a month, I highly recommend The Guesthouse. Offering one, two and three bedroom fully furnished suites, on Clark in Andersonville with access to transportation and to some of the great restaurants and shops in the area. Whether it's for business or just a vacation, book a stay at The Guesthouse Hotel, you will be welcomed with grace and charm.",,5
Outstanding comfortable and spacious accomodations,"For our group of locals celebrating a bachelor party mostly permanently residing in the suburbs, this was an excellent value and alternative for our stay in the Chicago area. We were amazed with the amount of space in our 2br, 2ba penthouse suite. The private rooftop access was definitely a bonus with a skyline view for our group of 5 to unwind and relax after a early morning of sailing from nearby Belmont harbor. We even took advantage and utilized the nice grill on the balcony to have a great dinner of grilled veggies, brats and bbq ribs which we got from the grocery store nearby. It is modern, clean, classy and has everything you need from it's own spacious kitchen area and even a washer/dryer. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the garage parking behind the lobby is also a great option. Would definitely recommend to visitors and locals alike looking to enjoy your time in the many nearby neighborhoods and exploring Chicago.",5
"Beautiful, elegant, first class & in a great location!!!","What a great hotel!!! The staff were so nice and accommodating. We rented the penthouse suite, which included a rooftop deck with comfortable chairs. We planned a graduation on the rooftop but when it rained the staff offered the library & lounging area downstairs for the party and it was a perfect space for the party. Our suite was two full bedrooms, a sleeper sofa, and a full kitchen. Also included full size washer & dryer, comfortable beds, and several other ammenities. It was in a perfect location in a nice neighborhood in North Chicago. Some of the best restaurants in Chicago were within walking distance. I highly recommend Giordano's pizza, follwed by George's Ice-Cream, and they are open late.",5
Great departure from downtown,"The perfect place to settle in and have an urban experience and a 'home away from home'. Great neighborhood with excellent eating and drinking options nearby (notably The Mango Room, Tweet, Little Big Wolf...yes you might wait, but this is Chicago so prepare yourself or go early). Walk to Wrigley if you like getting outdoors or jump in a cab/uber ride for less than $10. Head east for a short jog to the park, this makes for a great warmup so you can get your run in along the lake.",5
classy all the way,after a 26 hour flight from india the best part was to check in this hotel.,5
The neighborhood hotel of choice!,"We stayed in a darling two bedroom, with a balcony. This couldn't have been a better choice. Having a small kitchen made having breakfast in the morning and wine and snacks in the evening, a lovely experience. It is very roomy and so nicely appointed. There are plenty of restaurant choices relatively close and being in a neighborhood environment vs downtown was very enjoyable. The staff was so helpful and friendly. It was an intimate experience all the way around.",5
Lovely Stay!!,My stay at the Guesthouse was great. The property is just as pictured....,5
Home away from home,"I can't begin to tell everyone what a fabulous place the guesthouse is to stay at. Our daughter graduated from Loyola Law School so we were going to have family and friends attending, so I wanted a place we could entertain and have a Graduation party. We had a three bedroom unit that was so spacious, well appointed and luxurious. It was simply amazing. You will not be disappointed. It is truly such a nice place to stay as well as free parking which is a real plus in Chicago. The staff was very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. We will definitely stay here again if we travel back to that beautiful city. Thanks Guesthouse, you made our celebration a huge success!!",5
"We just returned from a extended weekend at the Guesthouse Hotel to celebrate our daughters graduation from law school. We had a three bedroom because we had family and friends coming in to celebrate and we wanted a place to entertain. It was fabulous, luxurious and just perfect for all. What a great place! You guys should be commended for going above and beyond. Even free parking which is a rare thing in Chicago. Thanks for a wonderful weekend and great memories!!",,5
Small Town Friendly with Upscale Standards,"We have stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel on a number of occasions as it is walking distance from our son's condo. The rooms are spacious, immaculate, and well laid out with kitchen facilities and comfortably sized living areas. We have stayed in numerous facilities over our many visits to Chicago and this remains our favorite. They have a pantry on the first floor which offers drinks and food choices which can be prepared in one's room. This place is a hidden gem.",5
Chicago Hotel - The Guesthouse - AMAZING!,"Traveling with your family is awesome, but it can be tough packing for all their needs. One reason we decided on The Guesthouse was because they literally had everything we needed for our two young children. Not having to bring everything from home saved us a lot of time and hassle. Besides being accommodating for kids, the suite and rooftops views were amazing. Very classy, very clean and a great location in Andersonville. We will definitely be staying there again when we visit Chicago.",5
A home away from home,This stay was a girl's trip to visit our friend's daughter who attends DePaul University,5
The Best of Andersonville,"Andersonville is an up-and-coming neighborhood on the north side of Chicago and The Guesthouse is the perfect base for exploring it. From Cubs games at Wrigley Field to hip gastropubs to antique shops, the neighborhood has a lot to offer. The suite we enjoyed for two days was immaculate, the bed was perfect, the service was friendly, and the ability to charge our electric car overnight was an added bonus. Next time we're in Chicago, we'll be back!",5
Great home away from home,"This place is just wonderful, starting from when you make the booking to when you leave. The 2BR/2 bath apartment we had was great. It was clean, very spacious, and felt like a home. Besides checking in, you forget you are at a guesthouse. They have a full laundry inside, and a full kitchen. It was nice to not be in a hotel for a bit, and catch up on laundry. It was also nice to have a couple friends over for dinner. The location is good too, within a short walk from Andersonville and Uptown. The train station is also not that far. It's also a nice neighbourhood for running. The price is not that much more than a hotel, and considering what you get, it's a great price. I will definitely be coming back.",5
Excellent choice for family,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Guesthouse Hotel in Andersonville, IL. For our family of 5, 3 bedrooms and 2 baths were a must. To be able to find a place as nice as the Guesthouse and stay around $300/night was great. Modern amenities (large custom shower with steam in the Master Bathroom, hardwood floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, large HDTV in the Living Room, wireless internet, washer/dryer) were top notch. Location was convenient for mass transit although we didn't use it during our visit. We drove into Chicago every day just after the morning rush which took about 15 minutes. Secure, reserved parking was a plus. The staff was great as well, answering our questions about the area and taking care of all of our needs during our stay. Again, we very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the Guesthouse to anyone visiting the Chicago area.",5
A wonderful apartment in Andersonville,"We've stayed twice at the Guesthouse Hotel within the past couple of months and will be back soon and often. It's the perfect ""home away from home""! We chose this hotel because our son and his family live nearby. But it's a great place for anyone who wants to enjoy a spacious apartment that includes a well-furnished full kitchen, living room and dining area. In addition to high ceilings, a deck and large windows, our three-bedroom unit included a fireplace. We've stayed in the one-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments, and both were bright and lovely spaces for individuals or families. Located within a short walk to the train station, several good restaurants and a large grocery store, it's a great option for exploring Chicago without the high prices of staying downtown. Thanks to Rick and his staff for being so warm and welcoming.",5
an excellent choice,"this was a perfect accommodation for myself, my son, his wife and two small children for our two week stay in my hometown of chicago. the apartment was spacious and had everything we needed to make this an ""at-home"" experience for our vacation away from home. in addition, the the apartment and the hotel reception area, lounge, library, were beautifully and tastefully decorated. the staff were accommodating, efficient, helpful, patient, friendly-throughout the whole process. i sent numerous emails with questions even before our acutual stay, that were answered immediatey\ly. such kind and pleasant people.",5
Awesome,"As soon as I saw the high ceilings, huge kitchen, spacious walk-in closets, and fabulous bathrooms, I wanted to move in. Everything was sleek and beautiful. It was so nice to be able to host friends for dinner, we grilled on the balcony. I asked for liquid dishsoap and it was sent up right away. Comfortable couch and beds. The Ikea armchairs were hard. I was not able to get the jambox to work. They had every kitchen utensil handy, salt and pepper, paper towels. The garage space ($20 per night) is very tight, listen to them when they say to leave the SUV at home! We had ordered groceries through Peapod, and the cold stuff was in the fridge when we arrived. Luxurious! I am definitely coming back someday.",5
Perfect stay,"Very quiet location, 3 blocks North you have a ton of restaurants in Andersonville. They upgraded me to a two bedroom at no extra charge. My son and friend was able to stay over. This room was size of condo with full kitchen and brand new. Will be coming back again.",5
Cc lose to family,"There is a lack of hotel rooms beyond the ballpark in Chicago. I was so delighted to find this friendly, clean, apartment style hotel so close to my family. I visit",5
Felt more like a luxurious condo than hotel room,"I recently stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel in Chicago. My son lives nearby and I wanted to be in close proximity yet have my ""own place"". This hotel was an excellent choice and truly lived up to its reputation of ""live like a local"". I felt like I had my own spacious condo with all of the amenities instead of an impersonal hotel room. The staff was most accommodating and very friendly. I had to stay an unexpected number of days and particularly appreciated the full size top-of-the-line washer and dryer and numerous special features of my ""condo"". The library was amazing and offered an extended number of reading selections. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago. It is close to all public transportation and within walking distance to many excellent restaurants and shops.",4
Fantastic,"My husband and I stayed here last year for a weekend and loved the area. Not far from downtown. We had our car and the hotel has a garage. It is like living in your own condo. Beautifully decorated and so comfortable. It was a little noisy one night. Loved sitting on the balcony although would prefer the front view, however the back does give you the sun in the afternoon. Staff was great. Loved the lobby. A must if you stay is to go to Mariano's Grocery Store to stock the kitchen. That is an experience in grocery shopping if you are from Canada.",5
A great place to stay. You will feel right at home.,,5
Andersonville Gem,"My in-laws (6 in all!) came to visit us here in Andersonville, so we called up the Guesthouse Hotel that we'd walked past and admired through the window many times. The staff could not have been more accommodating, and the two bedroom suite was perfect for the two couples who stayed there. We even cooked a huge family dinner in the open kitchen! Beautiful hotel, room and stay overall. We will be back!",5
Vacation time,"The condo we stayed in was quite beautiful. Very modern kitchen with a full set of appliances, dishes and quite a view! It also had two full bedrooms and two full baths, full size washer and dryer. It was very easy to walk to the bus stop, the L and to various stores and shopping. Andersonville is quite an area for foodies too. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. I would love to visit there again.",5
A True Gem,"Stayed at The Guesthouse last week while in town and it was great. The rooms are spacious,staff extremely friendly and helpful, and the parking was clean and secure. Will plan many more visits and would give it my highest recommendation",5
Authentic local experience.,"The Guesthouse Hotel allowed my family of five to maintain our daily routine with little distruption while our Chicago home's floors were being refinished. A full kitchen, washer & dryer, multiple bedrooms & parking allowed us to continue to ""live like locals"" even when temporarily displaced from our home. We had ample space to spread out and not feel cramped, were able to save $ by cooking our own meals and were even able to bring our pet. We can't thank the Guesthouse enough for making a stressful time much easier to manage by providing us a home away from",5
Awesome everything,"I can't write enough about how great the Guesthouse was. In an incredible neighborhood (Andersonville), walking distance from a grocer and all the bars and restos you could want. Incredible staff. Incredible amenities. Incredible showers and kitchen and furniture and space. There was even a Jambox in there so we plugged up our music and listen while we relaxed. I'll never stay anywhere else if I'm staying in this part of Chicago.",5
"Definetly ""Home Away From Home"". I have already recommended to friends. Located in a great neighborhood. Staff was excellent. Cant wait for my next visit yo Chicago.",,5
"If your are looking for intimacy, quiet and chic","I was in Chicago for an extended period of time for a busines trip. I wanted privacy, space and a hotel that was pet friendly. The GuestHouse Hotel was recommended by one of the managers.",5
Condo Living for Less Than Hotel Prices,"So apparently this place was designed as a condo building, then the developer had trouble selling so they turned it into a boutique hotel.",4
A Great Week-end in Chicago,"We had a great week-end in Chicago visiting our daughter. Our stay at the Guesthouse was extremely comfortable, considering that it was frigid outside with below-zero wind chills. Our suite was warm and cozy with a gas fireplace.",5
A great ADA Room experience !!,Many places we have stayed claim to be ADA compliant with their rooms but fall short of the ADA suite at the Guesthouse Hotel. Everything about the suite is totally wheelchair accessible.,5
Really awesome place and great part of town.,"The hotel is really beautiful and everyone was very friendly and helpful. The parking is private--in a garage stall you share with one other person. I had problems parking since I had a pickup truck (Smaller) but they took care of me. The hotel is within a five minute walk of the Andersonville Microbrew and the Hopleaf bar. Plus there are several antique stores and coffee shops. The hotel is also within a five minute walk to the Greenmill (where Charlie Chaplin and Al Capone drank) and the Riviera theater, where we saw Billy Idol :-)",5
"The Guesthouse Hotel is truly my ""Home away from Home""! I can't tell you which is better- the accommodations, staff or service...they are all phenomenal! The rooms are extremely spacious, comfortable and decorated in boutique-modern style. The staff is very friendly and helpful and address customers' by name. I travel to Chicago weekly and The Guesthouse genuinely makes me feel like I have a 2nd home vs. staying at a hotel. The staff has even proactively reached out to determine if I was visiting when I didn't have reservations in the system. I couldn't be happier with The Guesthouse! It is truly a home away from home.",,5
Live like a local,"That is the motto at The Guesthouse and it's true! From the moment we walked into the lobby, we knew we had chosen the right place. Everything about The Guesthouse is 'just right'. We stayed in the North building on the 4th floor in a 2 BR, 2 BA. It was beautiful and spacious. The kitchen was well stocked. Parking was very convenient (your own spot with a garage door opener). We were there for Friday and Saturday night concerts at Aragon and it couldn't have been more convenient. The staff was awesome too! They treated us like we were old friends... and we really appreciated that! Give this place a try - you won't regret it!",5
"This place rocks !!!! If going to a show at the Aragon this is THE place to stay , but even if you aren't going to a show you will feel like you are living the life as a local and Andersonville is one of the best places in Chicago to be a local !",,5
Great place and great value,"Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Basically an awesome 2 bedroom condo. Great value, lots of space. Fun neighborhood, easy walk to Aragon and Green Mill. Next time will stay longer and head to market couple doors down and make breakfast.",5
Pretty much a functional apartment,"My heater stopped working at my apartment just as a blizzard was blowing in to Chicago. I spent the night at the Guesthouse Hotel, and it was wonderful. It really was a fully functional apartment. The kitchen has some pots and pans, so I was even able to make myself a small dinner (and never venture outside). The rooms were immaculate, and the staff was very friendly and helpful (even when I had to check out at 4:30 AM). Without a doubt, I would recommend this place to anyone, and if I could afford to, I'd live there full time.",5
"Hotel ? More like ""Home sweet home ""","As I write this review I'm currently still in residence laying on the most comfortable sofa by the fireplace watching a little t.v . Three of us came to Chicago to see the String Cheese Incident at The Aragon Ballroom for three nights . We wanted to find a hotel within walking distance but had no idea we would be staying in a place so comfortable as home . We had a small party before the Saturday show with friends coming over from the Chicago area There was plenty of room for all . There is a full kitchen fully supplied with cooking gear . Two bathrooms , one with a jacuzzi bath and the other with a steam shower ! Plenty of closet space , a balcony and outdoor grill which would be great in the warmer season . I have a good friend living in Andersonville and have always loved the area with many multi ethnic restaurants on Clark Street A ten minute walk will take you to the L for traveling downtown .",5
Better than just a hotel room. Home away from home,For the location we needed it is perfect. We have stayed here over 4 times. And will be going back in March. Better than a hotel room all the comforts of home. Great value. Very clean and great service. The lobby is like a comfortable living room. Room is well furnished,5
Home away from home,"We traveled from upstate NY to Chicago to visit our 8-month old grandson (his parents, too). It's a 12-hour+ drive that usually leaves us spent. The Guesthouse was a cure for that road weariness. We stayed four nights and it felt like home. Friendly, helpful staff. Clean, comfortable accommodations. A full kitchen to make breakfasts (or any other meal). Room to stretch out. A locked garage to park the car. And easy walking distance to our kids' home in Andersonville. We'll stay again, for sure.",5
Feel like a local with amazing service and quality,"I can't say enough about the Guesthouse. I hosted an event there AND stayed with my family for three nights and everything was perfect. First, the staff was super helpful and friendly. The accommodations were wonderful. We had a two bedroom two bath and stayed with our son and just loved it. We felt right at home sharing the kitchen and living areas. The place was immaculate and well decorated, very comfortable. The actual guest space (lobby, library and sitting area) was where my event was handled and we were so comfortable and cozy, especially on a cold January day in Chicago. Parking with your own garage and abundant street parking for guests made this a easily accessible place to stay for all. We used to live in this neighborhood and know it well. To be so close to all the dining and shopping on Clark Street, and also on the bus line, was a real treat. We will stay here regularly.",5
A hidden gem,The Guesthouse Hotel is a MUST for those wanting a departure from your average hotel.,5
Simply Excellent,"Stayed in hotel apartment with Family whole family. Amenities excellent, flat super clean, staff very friendly and approachable. Location quiet and close to motorway within minutes drive from major attractions.",5
Keeps getting better,"Over the last seven years, we have stayed at this property, through its various incarnations, five times...and it gets better every time. Our party of six found it spacious, well furnished (my bed was particularly comfortable), clean, and a helpful staff. This time, with one- and three-year old granddaughters in tow, we ordered up the ""bath time box"" and the ""meal time box"" for them...this was terrific! They had everything you could need for the children. You will not go wrong in choosing GH for your stay.",5
Not your typical hotel,More of a rental apartment than a hotel. Very pleasant stay over the Christmas holiday with large rooms able to accommodate family that live locally. Surprisingly well-equipped kitchen with full sized appliances including a gas stove(!) that we used tor family meals. Nice balcony with gas grill. Exceptionally clean and well kept.,5
Guesthouse Hotel,"Great place to celebrate Christmas with family. Stayed in three bedroom suite. Very roomy with nice layout. Clean, fully equipped kitchen and gas fireplace. Wonderful steam shower in master. All front desk help very knowledgeable",5
Home away from home,"Stayed here during Christmas with 6 family members and was very cozy - stayed very warm and has working gas fireplace. Plenty of room so you are not ""on top"" of others, has nice appliances and great balcony. Water pressure in the guest bath shower could be better but master bath is OK and has steam feature. Basic IKEA furniture throughout the house but does the job, no TV in any bedroom. Far from the highway but easy to get to on the weekend.",5
Loved it,"This is a a great place to stay and relax. Wonderful area and truly beautiful hotel. Super large living areas,great bedrooms soft beds,really nice bathrooms and great views from balcony. A kitchen to really cook in. Everything you need times two. Loved my stay and would go back in a heart beat. Truly live like a local.",5
Could not ask for a nicer place,"Great place. Clean,friendly, great chocolate chip cookies in lobby . Perfect neighborhood to be in with restaurants and shopping. Having a garage for the car is a real bonus in the winter. Easy to get on Lake shore drive to go the shops on Michigan avenue.",5
Livin' Like a Local in Chicagoland,How do I review this outstanding place without simply restating much of the high praise provided by other reviewers? Some of this will be redundant but I‚Äôll try to throw in a couple personal observations.,5
Great place to stay with families,"I just happen to find this hotel as I was on business nearby. I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful it was. I felt like I was at home and not in a hotel. It is easy to get downtown by train, uber or taxi. I suggest Uber. Plenty of great places to eat around at all price ranges. I would reccommend to anyone! I plan on coming back with family for a trip in spring.",5
Friendly Staff,Last minute stay for business trip. It was very easy to get downtown through train or taxi. Rooms were massive with fully equipped kitchens. Would be ideal for a family trip. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the stay.,5
Home away from home...seriously!,"I came into Chicago for a wedding weekend stay and the wedding party had rooms booked for us here. I was in awe! It was not like a hotel at all but a luxury condo in the heart of Andersonville. We had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room, a full kitchen, washer and dryer, plus a deck with our own gas grill! I am not staying anywhere else when I come in! The staff were so friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Can't wait to stay there in the summer to enjoy the deck! The only possible negative is that they require a 3 night stay off peak and 4 night minimum during peak season.",5
"Easy, beautiful, fun location, great service","I visited Chicago with a group of 8 college friends, and this worked out great. It was clean and nicely decorated, very comfortable, and having the service in the lobby made it easier and more convenient than a normal VRBO or vacation rental.",5
Great for a family or group!,"Beautiful airy three-bedroom suite, with well-outfitted kitchen, and a lovely balcony (which we would have used had the temperatures not persuaded us otherwise!). I can't say enough good things about the friendly staff, who helped us map out a day with kids in the city. This is a really great option for a larger family or for a group like us (3 moms and 3 kids from different cities meeting up in Chicago) traveling together and wanting to get to enjoy each other in a relaxed setting, rather than perching on each other's hotel beds in a cramped room. Sitting in the living room, in front of a fire, with glasses of wine, while our boys played Legos with each other, was the perfect setting to catch up with old friends! Great little tienda down the street with any and all supplies, and the ""house restaurant"" delivered really yummy dinners the two nights we chose to eat in. Even in the bitter cold, the walk to the L was quick and easy, and we were also able to hail cabs (and an Uber!) quickly from the lobby.",5
Unforgettable experience,"Women's weekend in Chicago. Six of us shared a well appointed, luxurious three-bedroom suite. Restaurants, grocery store, independently owned shops, within blocks. The lobby was stunning and cozy. The staff were thorough and helpful. We faced Clark Street and had no issues with noice. Affordably priced, adjacent parking garages were a huge benefit, although street parking is easy in Andersonville. We didn't care, but the only TV was in the living room--might be a bummer for those of you who like to watch TV in bed. In Andersonville, check out the Bongo Room for breakfast/lunch (Guesthouse staff recommended) and the Gethsemane Garden Center and Gift Store. Will definitely be back.",5
Excellant accommodations,"We were in Chicago awaiting the birth of our sons first child. The location of the Guesthouse was within walking distance to his home, public transportation, grocery stores, restaurants and more. The rooms could not have been cleaner. The customer service was so accommodating. Beautiful lobby and library. We utilized the upscale appliances including the washer and dryer. We ordered food delivery from the recommended food delivery service (sorry I can't remember the name) and we very pleasantly surprised. Are stay was so relaxing, especially in the comfy beds. Our expectations were definitely met. üòÑüòÑüòÑ",5
"I highly recommend this great spot! We had family and friends camp out here for our long wedding weekend and it was such a great location for relaxing, getting ready with our grooms party, pictures in the gorgeous lobby, and relaxing on the rooftop! Thank you for the wonderful hospitality!!!",,5
The Guest House Hotel....simply the best !,"By saying ""simply the best"", one has to recognize what type of hotel this is. Boutique I guess I would have to call it. The staff is absolutely professional, helpful and friendly. We had reservations a month ago, and were on the bus from Portland Maine to Boston to fly to Chicago to visit my son and his wife, when we were notified that, as a result of the fire at the FAA facility outside of Chicago, our flight was cancelled. Trip cancelled until another time ! When we contacted The Guesthouse staff, we were past our refund time (I knew this when I called). However they offered to hold onto our paid in full credit until we could figure out another time for the trip....which ended up being this past weekend.",5
The Best place for staying with your family,We went to Chicago last august with our kids for one week,5
Wonderful Stay,"We recently stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel for a weekend. There was a group of 6 of us and there was plenty of room for everyone. The apartment was spectacular, both in location and the look of the apartment. It is close to plenty of restaurants and bars, with the El a quick walk and several buses right there. I would definitely recommend The Guesthouse Hotel to anyone who is in Chicago for a short or long stay!",5
Kurzaufenthalt in Chicago,"Wir hatten eine Suite mit 2 Schlafzimmern, 2 B√§der und einen ger√§umigen Wohn- Essbereich. Die K√ºche war komplett ausgestattet. Auf der Terrasse gab es einen Grill, der auch bei Regen funktionierte. Garagenstellplatz vorhanden. Alles sehr sauber und gepflegt. So eine tolle Unterkunft hatten wir nicht erwartet. Hilfreich war auch die N√§he zu √∂ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln.",5
Headquarters away from home.,We were in Chicago visiting our son and had to good fortune to stay at the Guesthouse Hotel. We had a two bedroom suite with a full gourmet kitchen. We made the short walk to Mariano's (an equally awesome grocery store) to stock up on snacks and appropriate happy hour beverages and our suite became the headquarters for our visit to Chicago. Not many hotels rooms make a great place for family and friends to congregate.,5
Excellent hotel alternative,"First things first. This isn't a traditional hotel arrangement. There isn't housekeeping and you'll be expected to leave the property in the state you found it. That being said, that means just taking out the trash, tossing the towels in the washing machine and adjusting the thermostat. Big deal. 5 minutes of your life. What you get for Half to a third the cost of a hotel downtown is a massive (800 sq ft?) condo apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms a full kitchen full living room a balcony a barbecue and residence in the authentic and honest north Chicago neighborhood of Andersonville.",5
"Our family ""lived local""","We came in for our son's college homecoming football game with our daughter, son and his fianc√©. We wanted to be close to northpark univeristy and have ""more than a hotel room"". Andersonville was very close. The guesthouse was gorgeous and we rented the penthouse with our own rooftop deck where we sat every night watching the city.",5
Living the Dream!,"Hubby and I stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel this past weekend and what a wonderful time we had. When they say ""live like a local"" they mean it, but I would say it was even better than that. From the luxurious finishes (hello steam shower!!) of our suite to the overly accommodating staff, it was a weekend to remember. I also love the location - 5 minutes to the train, DivvyBikes or fun neighborhood establishments of Andersonville.",5
The best Hotel I ever stayed at.,The Guest house hotel was a home away for home. I'm a handicap person and the room had plenty of room for my wheelchair. The bathroom was perfect. I could take my wheelchair into the shower with no problem. The staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. They helped my daughter in law and me with places to eat shop and just general info. The whole lobby is welcoming and warm. You can sit in the lobby room and watch TV or have a meeting in the library. We made dinner in the equipted kitchen. Both of us had our own bedroom. We could alse grill out on the pourch for our suite. Guest House will be first on the list when I travel again.,5
What a gem!,We stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel this past weekend and we honestly spent much of out time there gushing about how great it was and how glad we were to have found it. We have five children so traveling with the whole crew is not usually easy - but we love to travel so we usually just suck it up. We lived in Chicago for several years and we are now a few hours a way. Now that we have found The Guesthouse we will be able to travel to one of our favourite cities much more easily. We are so excited about that!,5
Out of town guest oasis,I had family come to Chicago for the marathon and had them stay here instead of everyone filling my condo. The guesthouse is perfectly located in the Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago. This is one my favorite places to bring visitors for the restaurant and bar options so it's perfect for them to stay in the hood and walk to everything.,5
A Stylish Comfortable Place for Pets and Their Owners,"We were looking for a pet friendly place for a week in transition when moving to Chicago. Wow! What a fantastic place! Stylish, comfortable, every amenity, great location, helpful & friendly staff, on site parking, AND pet friendly! With or without pets, a fabulous stay!",5
Better than a traditional hotel!,"My family stayed at The Guesthouse Hotel for a nearby wedding in October '14. Usually when we travel with our kids, we have to get two adjoining rooms at a hotel, then deal with not having a kitchen by putting our own snacks in the mini bar or just ordering room service constantly. Therefore, the condo-style layout of the Guesthouse Hotel was a breath of fresh air! I felt like we were staying in a friend's very nice apartment. We had our groceries delivered so they were there when we arrived, we all got our own space, and were able to have friends that were also staying there come hang out in our room without having to sit on a bed. We stayed in a beautiful 3-bedroom unit, which was very reasonably priced, and we will definitely be back on future trips to Chicago!",5
Love the Guesthouse Hotel in Andersonville.,We had a wonderful stay at the Guesthouse Hotel Sept 11-14. We were in town for a wedding which took place in Andersonville. We will be visiting Chicago many more times and plan to stay at the Guesthouse each time!,4
Great area and awesome place to call home,"This pale was great. They were just completing renovations, so it was a little noisy in the mornings. However it is a beautiful building. The condo is modern with new appliances and everything you need to make it feel like home. The neighbourhood in on the edge of Andersonville, a great area with lots of boutique type food places and great restaurants. There is a 24 hour concierge available in case you need anything. The staff is also very polite, friendly and knowledgeable of things that are going on and places to check out. They also are incredibly helpful with the best way to get around and what to see in Chicago. I would go back to the Guesthouse in a heartbeat and it's only about 5 blocks from the train so you can get around easily. There are little boutique shops in the area including their lobby, and great antique shops in the area to find hidden treasures",4
True Gem!,"This hotel is truly wonderful. It's in a great neighborhood, located close to everything to do with Chicago. The two bedroom suite is absolutely stunning and the staff was wonderful. It is clean, smartly decorated, spacious and quiet. Rick, the owner was so gracious and accommodating. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!",5
Great Hotel,"This is a great place to stay for family functions-weddings,birthdays ,etc. Staff is friendly and helpful. Neighborhood has good restaurants and shops. Transportation is no problem.My family is looking forward to more stays at the Guesthouse.",5
"Perfect, spacious and surprisingly chic!","Incredibly impressed with this hotel. I stayed in an apartment suite with two bedrooms and it was plenty of space! Love that they had everything we needed in terms of cookware, flatware, etc. I would imagine this would be a great place to stay with children or with a group of 2-3 friends. Especially impressed with the decor of the lobby area and the appliances/design of the bathrooms.",5
THE Place to Stay in Chicago,"What a wonderful place! Our 2 bedroom ""apartment"" was sparkling clean, comfortable, had a terrific shower (something I always judge!), and the most incredible bed and pillows we've experienced. Our covered balcony had table and chairs with a great gas grill. The lobby is great fun and relaxing with pictures depicting the history of Chicago, a wonderful little boutique, a great library, and excellent and accommodating staff. There are some great neighborhood restaurants within walking distance; The Guesthouse is right on the Clark Street bus line; easy also to hail a cab; Andersonville is the perfect location. We have been to Chicago many times, always staying downtown. No more! We will come back to The Guesthouse again and again. Highly recommended.",5
Great local option while staying in Chicago,"We were planning a business meeting in Chicago with people coming in from different cities. Little did we know the dates we chose were during a convention where over 100,000 people were scheduled to be there. We were scrambling to find a place for everyone to stay. The Guesthouse Hotel was recommended by a friend of a friend and did not disappoint. While the location is a little further away from the heart of the city, the amenties and property more than made up for it.",5
Another great stay at the Guesthouse,"This was our second time staying at the Guesthouse. They have expanded and have some additional amenities, including a small fitness center. The apartment was as well maintained as it was at our first visit. The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. We had a two bedroom unit in the south building which is very spacious. They provided a stroller and a high chair for our grandson. That was a great bonus! Having access to the parking garage is a huge convenience. We highly recommend this facility particularly if you want to be in the north side of Chicago. As someone else mentioned, there can be noise from aircraft flying to O'Hare. We didn't notice this during our first visit so perhaps the flight paths have changed. I always bring ear plugs when I travel so that helped. Obviously, this is not something the management has any control over.",5
Spectacular!!,My friends and I stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment over Labor Day weekend and loved it!! The apartment was well furnished and clean. Looks exactly like the photos. We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. We enjoyed making meals and also got to fire up the grill on our I last night. The steam shower in the master suite was awwwesssome!! Could not get enough of it. It especially worked its magic after a long day of doing touristy stuff. The staff was always available and very helpful. The washer and dryer in the apartment was also a plus. Saved us from having to travel with dirty laundry. Will definitely be staying here again.,5
High expectations exceeded!,"We had been to Chicago 4 times and always stayed downtown at fun fancy hotels and then just taken the blue/red lines to the neighborhoods we wanted to see for the day. This time we had an awkward number of people for a hotel (5) so the condo search began. After looking at many options we felt like it was time to mix it up and stay in a neighborhood - and take a train into downtown (if we even felt we needed that!). The booking system was easy and they promptly answered any questions/concerns. We flew into Chicago confident and excited about our stay. Upon arrival the condo was as beautiful, clean, stylish and comfortable as the pictures promised. The staff was attentive, friendly and helpful.",5
Incredible Vacation Rental-style hotel,"Wow, I cannot say enough nice things about this place. We had another rental that did not work out so we were scrambling the day we arrived in Chicago to find a place to sleep 7 adults and three under three year olds. They were the first to answer my phone calls and even though it was higher uptown than we had been looking previously, we had no problem Uber-cabbing to get where we needed to go. Adam at the front desk was incredibly nice and extremely helpful. He went above and beyond his duty for sure. Not only were we amazed at the gorgeous front desk/reception area (wish MY house looked like that!!) but our three bedroom unit was beautifully sleek and modern as well. I knew it was all Ikea, but man they did a spectacular job decorating. Plus the steam shower in the master bedroom was to die for ;) anyway, the exact location is across the street from a beautiful old cemetery and a few blocks south of a fantastic little hip neighborhood. You know you're in a hip area when the bodega sells gluten free items and organic Amy's pizza. Anyway the hotel has 24 hour manned front desk and a plethora of baby amenities (we borrowed a crib, a bouncy chair, a baby play ""station"" and a kit of kids dishes that really came in handy. Oh and a video monitor! They really thought if everything, down to the small ceramic bowls on the nightstands to put your rings on when you go to bed. The only bad thing about the place was a lack of full length mirrors. There was one in the master bedroom that everyone had to share. So that would be my only complaint, big whoop lol. I cannot say enough nice things about this place and would stay here in a heartbeat, thank you so much for making our Chicago weekend amazing!!",5
Good value for family.,"A very good venue for visiting Chicago. The apartments are very well equipped and furnished. They are spacious and spotlessly clean. The location appears a little strange initially being surrounded by car repair workshops, however the neighbourhood is full of excellent restaurants and is an easy bus ride into Central Chicago .",4
Great apartment in Andersonville,"We spent 5 nights at the Guesthouse hotel, in a 2 bed apartment (401). As a family, we loved the space and the fact that the apartment was so well equipped. Access to the roof terrace was a nice benefit, though we didn't use it other than to admire the view of downtown Chicago at night. Front desk staff were helpful and the lack of daily housekeeping services was not an issue, as there were plenty of linens and a very powerful washer and dryer. The only thing that was not completely perfect was the noisy air con, though this was very effective. The beeping sound made by the elevator on arrival was also pretty loud, and could be heard in the master bedroom. But, other than those issues, we had a great stay, and thoroughly enjoyed living like locals in Andersonville.",4
Fantastic stay,"We stayed in one of the 3 bedroom units. We had absolutely everything that we needed in this very comfortable, clean and well designed unit. You truly can "" live like a local"" but help in there at the check-in space if you need it. We have absolutely nothing but good things to say. We found the staff to be generous and helpful. The location is great and public transportation is pretty easy to figure out ( #22 Clark Street Bus)! We had a wonderful time and will stay here again!",3
Superlative,"Our family of 6 thoroughly enjoyed this spacious spectacular condo for 5 days. The classic Chicago shotgun hallway ended into a master bedroom with a gorgeous master bath that included a steam shower. The other full bath was more than adequate for our 4 kids. The Jenn Air appliances and Best range hood along with a generous supply of cooking utensils permits gourmet cooking (a Treasure Island and Whole Foods are an easy drive away). The grill worked great too. The Lawrence El stop is easily walkable as are the many restaurants in Andersonville. Plenty that deliver too! Service was very attentive and helpful. When we needed a different garage to accommodate our rooftop car carrier, they made the switch without hesitation. I could not say enough good things about it --for any family so large as to require 2 hotel rooms this is a no brainer -- stay here, you'll be ecstatic you did.",5
Great alternative to downtown,We visited our son in Chicago and this hotel was about a mile form his apartment. The location is on Clark Street at the southern end of Andersonville in an area which appears to be undergoing restoration and development. We had a two-bedroom suite complete with kitchen and a small balcony overlooking the back. Everything appears brand new (hope they keep it that way) with all the amenities you want and quite high tech. The only drawback is don't plan a sit down dinner party as there is no dining table just four stools at the bar. But you will probably spend your time out and about including the many bars and restaurants in Andersonville. There are also some nice grocery and specialty food stores as well. The hotel also provides for a fee parking garages in the back. They give you a garage door opener so you can come and go as you please. We just left our car there and hopped on the 22 bus which stopped right outside.,5
Great Accommodation for a large group or family,"The condo was awesome! It was spacious and great for a large group or family. The furniture and decor is modern and the kitchen is well equipped with everything you need with a starter supply of coffee, cream, toilet paper, paper towels and washer detergent. Linens and towels were more than enough so we didn't have to call for replacements during the week we stayed at the Guesthouse. The unit was very clean and the sauna shower in the master bath was amazing.",4
Chicago Vacation,"Very much enjoyed our stay at The Guesthouse Hotel. Rooms were far more than what we were expecting, very spacious, beds were incredibly soft, kitchen was nicely appointed, and I enjoyed sitting on the deck each morning listening to the city wake up and get moving. Front desk people were amazing, one even went and found a cheese grater for us when we asked. Very helpful in ideas for how to see and get around the city.",5
Great Alternative to chain hotels,"Our party of four people spent a week at the Guesthouse Hotel in August 2014. What a great place to stay. We had a two bedroom suite which was very clean and spacious with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, two bedrooms and two bathrooms with contemporary furniture and hardwood floors. This is a great value for larger parties compared to chain hotels which do not have the floor space to accommodate everyone, nor the amenities and parking that come with this package. It's in a nice neighborhood with great restaurants, an upscale grocery store (Marianno's), a small boutique shops. Also, easy access to downtown Chicago. I recommend this hotel without qualification.",5
"Happy to ""live like a local""","We enjoyed the space, amenities and the cleanliness. Proximity to public transport, restaurants, specialty shops and grocery stores is excellent. The secure parking for our vehicle and general good value for money was appreciated. The noise from other tenants on two nights did detract from the general tranquility of the suite. We saw that the management dealt with the problem by posting signage about quiet time. Potential customers need to understand that the location is very urban and therefore street noise is part of the package. The decor and finishing touches are beautiful, the lobby with its library and relaxation space is second to none.",5
The Guesthouse Hotel,"The rooms were nice, new and clean. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony at night and even used the gas grill out there once. The location is good, near restaurants and you can walk to the L. Staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.",5
Up On The Roof,"When you stay on the 4th floor, you are afforded access to the roof.From the roof you can get a 360 degree view of the skyline. From the front roof you can get a view of the cemetery. The staff was universally friendly, the rooms were well appointed and clean. This hotel is close to quite a few good restaurants and bars. Anything that isn't close is accessible by great public transportation. I have only one complaint which is not a fault of the hotel but I wish they could have dome something about it. There was a room with Adult women and teenage girls next door. There was a great deal of running around and opening and closing of doors. The noise detracted from the classy experience.",5
Great place to stay,"We spend five nights during July 2014 in room 410. It was really a pleasant place to stay with plenty of space in a nice neighborhood accessible to public transportation. It would have been perfect if it were just a bit closer to the Loop. I think it took us 20-30 minutes to get to the Loop depending if we walked to the L or got a bus. The hotel is wonderful, though.",5
Tenant noise,"Great overall stay except the party noise. The rules state that loudness should be tempered after 9:00 pm. This did not happen 3 of the 4 nights. In fact, we had very little sleep for 3 full nights. Partying with ""Boom Boxes"" etc etc on the roof top and unit next to us was crazy. Our unit SHOOK the last night. We continually contacted the front desk ? The front desk agreed it was not allowed and would take care of the situation. However , Our last night was the worst. The noise lasted nearly all night.",4
perfect pet friendly place,"loved our stay and will definitely be back. the other reviews are spot on ... this place has it all! space, clean, beautifully appointed, great location, comfortable beds, nice staff ....",5
Awesome condo in great location,"This was a great spot to explore Chicago. The neighborhood of Andersonville is very trendy, with lots of shops and eateries. It is close to the Redline El station - about a half mile, which takes you right into downtown. Cub stadium is 1.5 miles, so another easy walk. The beach is about a mile away and a great spot for walkers and runners.",5
"""Live like a local"" is right","You won't find a more authentic Chicago experience than The Guesthouse. Unlike the downtown and Michigan Avenue hotels, you're in a real neighborhood‚Ä¶an up and comer called Andersonville, with trendy bars and a nice assortment of eateries. The rooms are all suites and are spacious and incredibly well equipped with full-service appliances and accessories. Both in the public rooms and in the suites, the decor is stylish and beautiful. If you have a multi-night stay in Chicago in your future and want spacious accommodations, this is the place for you.",5
The perfect Chicago holiday,"I recently stayed in The Guesthouse Hotel, based on other reviews I'd read on Trip Advisor. It definitely lived up to its glowing reviews. The apartments are stunning, very clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful, and Andersonville is a lovely neighbourhood away from the tourist traps of downtown. The Mariano's supermarket a couple of blocks away is amazing, are there are plenty of great restaurants, cafes and gift shops nearby.",5
Loved it!,"I stayed here for 4 nights. I live in the suburbs of Chicago and often like to spend time in the city. The staff was fabulous, the apt. was well equipped, close to markets, transportation, and really pet friendly.",5
Great Stay,"This property is as beautiful as the pictures show. The neighborhood is also decent, although maybe not quite as lively as Lincoln Park or somewhere a bit more central. It's walkable from Wrigley Field (little under 2 miles), and parking is available, although it's around $23 per night. We stayed for a long weekend (6 adults in a three bedroom/two bath), and we found it to be very enjoyable.",4
THE best place to stay in Chicago!,"The Guesthouse Hotel, compared with other hotels in Chicago, gives you the best value for your money. We are a family of four, who stayed comfortably in this hotel that was more like an apartment. One of the many things I loved about The Guesthouse was having our own kitchen to have breakfast before we left the hotel for the day. Not only did we save money that way, it's also much easier when you have children traveling with you. The staff was very courteous and friendly. We absolutely loved our stay at The Guesthouse Hotel!",5
Our second stay at the Guesthouse,"Truly a home away from home whilst visiting family in Andersonville,where we indeed ""lived like locals"".The units are very well appointed and maintained with all facilities of home including a balcony with gas BBQ.",5
The ONLY Place to Stay While Visiting Chicago,"We have stayed twice at The Guesthouse and are heading to Chicago for our third stay next month. We travel extensively, and The Guesthouse is one of the best accommodations that we've found anywhere in the country. The units are beautifully appointed with the highest quality furnishings and linens; there is a washer and dryer; the kitchens are stocked with everything you need to make dinner for your family and friends; and, the location is beyond ideal. Add to all of this the fact that the entire staff is so friendly, helpful and easy to work with and I simply can't imagine a better place to stay. The Guesthouse should start a consulting business to teach other hotels how to do it!",5
"Their slogan ""Live Like a Local"" really sums it up!","Great location in the Andersonville Neighborhood and out of the crazy regular tourist trap of downtown. This hotel really makes you feel like home. The space is well designed and the staff is very friendly. The hotel has 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms available all with a full kitchen. They are also connect to a spa called Revive which is very convenient for a relaxing day!",5
Amazing accommodations,"We stayed here for four nights with relatives visiting from Australia. We had a two bedroom suite. The apartment was beautifully decorated and incredibly spacious. The hotel is close to both the bus and train, and other amenities. We will definitely stay here again. Down the street are many restaurants. I would recommend The Hopleaf.",5
Well appointed and comfortable,"The guesthouse was a most pleasant surprise in being clean, accommodating, and fully appointed to meet our needs.. The beds and linen were superb. The split floor plan was perfect. The staff was top notch. We will suggest to others and most definitely return.",5
What a great find!!,"We stayed in a beautiful 2 bedroom condo for a week recently and was blown away by the upscale appointments, comfortable bedding and friendly staff! The price is the same as a downtown hotel, so this is a no brainer!",5
Exceeded expectations!,We rented a 3 bedroom for our wedding during Pride weekend and were amazed at the size of the apartment...the hall down to the master bedroom seemed a quarter block long! It was very clean and well-appointed. Very nice d√©cor with comfortable furniture and great appliances.,5
Fabulous Facility,"I just spent 10 days at the Guesthouse hotel with my daughter and my toy poodle, it was amazing! The rooms are beautiful, spacious, and fully stocked. The staff made sure that my entire customer experience was pleasant from beginning to end. My daughter has several special needs, the staff exceeded every one of them, AND they did it with kindness, consideration, and a smile. This place is exceptional! They make you feel like they appreciate your business and that they enjoy having you there, that's a BIG deal! No question - we will stay here on our next visit to Chicago. Thank you Rick, Shelly, and the entire Guesthouse staff. Your fabulous facility, and ""top notch"" Customer Service helped to make our vacation an unforgetable time that I will always cherish.",5
"We are currently staying at the Guest House. My daughter had a major surgery at Rush and we needed to stay somewhere while she recovered until our trip home to SC. Armond brought her beads from the gay pride parade that she wanted to attend but could not, and they just delivered a half a dozen long stem sunflowers, from the staff at The Guest House. The accommodations are exceptional and although we have no family here they have treated us as such. It has been a blessing to find such wonderful people at a beautiful ""hotel"".",,5
Maiden voyage :-) !!!,"Our first stay at the Guest House was wonderful! I made numerous phone calls with questions for our stay. Rick was always extremely helpful, from telling us about Mariano's grocery to where was the closest drop for our rental car....",5
Awesome,Perfect for me and all my friends. Clean new and in a great spot. TV with surround sound. Large rooms with lots of closet space. The managers were nice and willing to work with you. Don't see why you would want to stay anywhere else in Chicago besides the guesthouse.,5
"Quiet, Beautiful Room",My office is in Ravenswood and I initially picked The Guesthouse Hotel due to it's location. I was very pleasantly surprised at my stay.,5
New Hotel is Fabulous!,My first stay at the Guest House was about a year ago. How things have changed! Including the Name! The GuestHouse Hotel is now expanded to double it's size. The just opened beautiful lobby is appointed with awesome black and white mixed with color photo's and art work of the city of Chicago. Walk over to the check in area and you are greeted by a friendly and extremely helpful staff.,5
"Like having your own place in the city, without all the additional cost","We only stayed for one night, but we will be back. Location was great for City activities. We went to Maestros. Location also works well for activities in the Burbs, we golfed at Chicago Highlands. The unit was brand new with great design features and everything you need for a weekend or longer stay. The service was great, parking was secure and convenient. The lobby is hard to describe, but to say you have to see it and you will not be dissapointed.",5
Great Place to Stay in Chicago!,"We came to Chicago for my nephew's wedding weekend. We were so pleased to stay in a beautiful condo! What a wonderful change from an ordinary hotel. You are pleasantly greeted as you step into the beautiful lobby by the great staff. We had plenty of room to spread out, 2 bathrooms, spacious kitchen to prepare food and room to visit with other family members also staying there. The condos are gorgeous, comfortable and even offer a gas grill on your personal deck. There is a washer and dryer for longer stays and the kitchen is well equipped for relaxing and 'eating in'. A short walk takes you to the Red Line to access Chicago activities, as well as, Andersonville offers many shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance. On site parking garages made us happy to avoid parking on the street. We recommend anyone staying a weekend or a couple of weeks to visit the Guesthouse Hotel - it's not your ordinary hotel. It's a home away from home!",5
Great find!,"I recently traveled to Chicago from out of state and stayed at the Guesthouse Hotel. I was extremely impressed by the elegance and detail found in the lobby upon checking in. Everyone I came into contact with, especially the General Manager, Rick, was very polite and helpful. I stayed in a 2 bedroom with a deck and it felt as if I were staying in my own home, versus a hotel room. The furnishings were modern and aesthetically pleasing, and the entire place was extremely clean. It was wonderful to have a kitchen with all necessary items to cook, in order to eat some meals there. The location was fantastic... a short walk to the Red Line el, not far from the lakefront, and close to great restaurants and shops in Andersonville. Highly recommend this property!",5
Wedding Weekend Fun,"A destination wedding brought our family to downtown Chicago for a long weekend. We were pleasantly surprised to find out we were staying at the Guesthouse properties. What an entrance! The lobby welcomes you in with beautiful decor, friendly helpful staff and even had a personal touch added for the wedding activities. Upon entering our condo we were greeted again with stunning decor. Hardwood floors, granite countertops and stainless steel appliances in the fully stocked kitchen, modern furniture in the living space and a private balcony complete with a table and chairs and Weber grill provided outdoor relaxation after the days activities. Spacious bedrooms with amazing bathrooms provided plenty of room for our family of four. Walk in closets with dressers (master) and built in shelves (second) were an added bonus! The washer and dryer allowed us to tackle some of our laundry on an as needed basis. Being walking distance from wonderful local shops and eateries in Andersonville provided options if we weren't using the kitchen or going into the city. And the Red Line being a few blocks away made it easy to get to Wrigley, Shed Aquarium and Michigan Avenue. Having a parking space included was another bonus having driven in from out of state. We're already telling people about this property and will continue to do so! The staff and accommodations made our weekend that much better knowing all the bases were covered. Definitely a must see!",5
Son's Festive Wedding Weekend,My son's Chicago destination wedding brought ten family members together from four states.,5
"Boutique hotel, vacation rentals merge for an outstanding experience","The Guesthouse Hotel in the historic Andersonville neighborhood of Chicago provided us with a unique blend of vacation rental and boutique hotel, the first time we'd encountered such a delightful combination. Owners David and Simona Krug, who we met early on, began with 10 units, originally designed as luxury condominiums at 4866 N. Clark, and they just finished an addition that ups the total to 25.",5
Truly Unique and Special Expierence,"We had the pleasure of being one of the first guests in the new addition to The Guesthouse this weekend, and it surpassed all expectations! The lobby was stunning, modern, and welcoming, and our 2 bedroom suite was just as amazing. The suite makes you feel just as comfortable as being at home, which most hotels cannot provide. It was very private, and the onsite parking was convenient and made getting around easy. The suite was beautifully decorated, and included a full kitchen, patio, and grill. It was spotless. The staff was friendly, and Rick, the manager, went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed.",5

I can't recommend The Guesthouse enough! We had a truly unique and excellent experience! Can't wait to go back!",,5
Comfortable home base for exploring Chicago,"We had a really nice 2 bedroom suite with a spacious living room and a well-equipped kitchen. And a grill outside (for when the notorious Chicago weather allows it)! Friendly and helpful staff. The place was spotlessly clean. Perfect location -- Andersonville has many nice restaurants in walking distance, and two grocery stores, too. One of the grocery stores has a piano bar! Reasonable walk to CTA train. Great place for a family visit to the big city.",5
A great value,"If you have never stayed in a suite while traveling with family or another group, you are in for a nice surprise at the Guesthouse Hotel. Grabbing some food for breakfasts and picnic lunches at a nearby supermarket lets you easily meet individual dietary requirements and personal food preferences, something that is a challenge in restaurants. And it saves a LOT on dining out, making the Guesthouse Hotel a great value. Our unit was very well-supplied with kitchen utensils and pots and pans ‚Äì we even made an apple cobbler dessert to go with our grilled steak dinner. We had a ground-floor 2 bedroom suite with patio that is apparently a little smaller than some of the other units, but it was still very roomy, and the kitchen was as big as our kitchen at home. The Guesthouse is decorated in an elegant, minimalist style that makes it a stress-free refuge from the wonders of Chicago. I love getting a birds-eye view of the Northside neighborhoods from the Red Line EL train to the Loop. I would definitely return to the Guesthouse Hotel, and I recommend it whole-heartedly to all.",5
Fantastic!,"Thank you Rick and staff for an amazing experience for my business team. From booking, to arrival and then departure, we were well taken care of by the team at the Guesthouse. We appreciated all of the extra steps you took to make it easy for us to conduct business but also have a relaxing stay. The accommodations were not only beautiful, but also comfortable. We loved having the amenities of home (washer, dryer, full kitchen, and fireplace) as well of the convenience of city living. This is a gem for not only the Uptown neighborhood, but for Chicago as well. Hands down, the Guesthouse is our preferred Chicago hotel!",5
Truly live like a local - with LOTS of room!,"Very spacious accommodations in a fantastic, walkable neighborhood. The Guesthouse Hotel in Andersonville has massive, condo-like apartments which are perfectly appointed for a comfortable, extended stay. The staff is extremely helpful with lots of good tips on how to really live like a local in the fun neighborhood. The steam sauna function in the shower is amazing!!",5
Great place to stay,We booked this after seeing it on internet. You dread arriving and it is nothing like the pictures. This most definetly is not the case at the Guesthouse. We had a 3 bedroomed apartment which was large. spacious and really well equipped. The staff are wonderfully helpful.,5
Perfect family vacation headquarters,"Loved staying at The Guesthouse! Excellent location away from the hustle and bustle while only a 15 min drive to everything. Great shops and restaurants a short walk away. Plenty of space for our family of 5 to spread out with beautiful finishes. Used the grill out on the deck most nights. Best part was the service. We arranged for Peapod grocery delivery and didn't arrive on time to receive it. The staff received our groceries and put everything in the unit for us. After a 6 hour drive, arriving to a fully stocked refrigerator (with 3 kids) was a small miracle...thank you! Would stay here again without hesitation!",5
We love The Guesthouse Hotel,"We've been making the Guesthouse our home away from home for the past three years. Our daughter was married last year and family and friends just about filled the place! Daughter #2 is getting married in September and we'll all be there again. It's the perfect location, indoor parking, great kitchen and lot's of light! And I can't wait for the new workout room. We love The Guesthouse Hotel!",5
Excellent place to stay!,"This is our second time staying at the Guesthouse Hotel. The staff is very accomodating and the rooms are luxurious and very clean. The hotel is in the heart of the thriving Andersonville and still only a short cab ride to downtown Chicago. We were able to easily fit our family of six in the three bedroom apartment, and the kitchen is a wonderful addition to cook some meals at ""home."" The free indoor parking is a huge bonus too! I would highly recommend staying here!",5
A steal!,"I took a film crew to Chicago to shoot a tv pilot and we wanted a lot of things: Free indoor parking, good wifi, a clean large space with lots of light and to be left alone to our own devices. The staff at the AGH were fantastic, always kind and very accomidating. We'll definitely stay again! We looked a lot at other places and so glad we chose this place. -yesplustv",5
Beautiful place to live like a Chicago local!,"Our stay at the Guesthouse was fantastic! The staff is accommodating and friendly, the building and rooms are immaculate, well-maintained and luxurious. The fully equipped kitchen has all the latest Jenn-Air appliances, granite countertops and incredible lighting, but if you prefer to ""grill out"" the stainless steel barbeque has lots of capacity! The great room allows you to hang out in front of the fireplace while you watch the large flatscreen tv or chill on the expansive deck outside.",5
Christmas family gathering,"This is to confirm the rave reviews for the Andersonville Guesthouse Hotel. Our family of six shared a 3-bedroom apartment over Christmas that was spacious, spotless, and very well managed. We enjoyed shopping in the diverse array of stores in the immediate neighborhood (especially the Swedish bakery), baked cookies and bread in the well-equipped kitchen, and even hosted an extended family gathering. The management kindly provided a gift of champagne and excellent chocolates! I've stayed in many vacation rental apartments, and this one was hands down the most pleasant and professionally managed.",5
What a grand experience,"Chicago is one of the great cities of the world. So much flavor, so many neighborhoods, such a distinct personality. Recently revisited Chicago, stayed in a ""neighborhood,"" the up-and-coming Andersonville. Andersonville Guesthouse? How cool. Here's the bottom line: A flavorful, textured n'hood, filled with cool stores (from 1-10) and amazing eateries; nicest people I've met, at any given venue, in years; and the Guesthouse? OK, here's the deal (from someone who rents apts. around the world): Huge space, nicely appointed, anything and everything you could want is there, from soap, etc., to culinary implements that I no longer possess at home; management is beyond wonderful, certainly world-class but more than that; no intrusiveness, which is important to me, but one is aware of ""caring"" from the management if one should need it; every single person with whom I dealt, from the Guesthouse to any and every shop or cafe or restaurant which I visited, was dear/amazing/lovely/stunning. Is this an accident? No. So, I return to the Andersonville Guesthouse, which starts the tour, advance to the n'hood with its amazing stores and eateries. I am left with this query: Am I imagining this?",5
Fabulous Find in Chicago!,"Our family takes a 4-5 day trip each year to a different MLB ballpark and in 2013 we descended on Chicago. We are always looking for something more than ""just a hotel,"" somewhere where we can cook together, play cards and just get all 16 of us together in the same room.",4
accommodating and comfortable,"I hosted 6 friends from college here in late July. We go to a different city each summer and we all agreed this was the top place we've stayed over the years. The general manager, Rick Verkler, from the beginning of my inquiry, communicated fully and quickly to questions. Once we got there, he helped us figure out transportation, restaurants, and other tips to help us have a great trip. There is room for one car to park (garaged); the place is right on the Clark 22 bus, and less than half a mile from the Red Line subway/el (which takes you downtown). Both are fast and safe. You are also fairly close to Wrigley Field (also on Clark Street). Andersonville feels like a neighborhood, which is a great way to explore Chicago, where neighborhoods are a key feature. We had originally wanted to stay in the Loop, but are really glad that didn't work out, as this place was perfect. I recommend a unit on the top floor, as you have some nice views. There is no pool and no fitness room, not that we had time for those, since we were so busy exploring Chicago!",5
"Could be perfect, but is flawed.","Previous reviews have properly praised the great features of Andersonville Guesthouse (""AG""). I endorse the high praise for the excellent features of accommodations. But I also have several criticisms ...",3
Andersonville Guesthouse Delivers Yet Again,"David & Simona,",5
Family Gathering,"Our July 2013 stay at the Anderson Guesthouse was wonderful!. We traveled from three states and met our adult children in Chicago. The Andersonville location proved to be an excellent choice! Our 3 bedroom- 2 bath apartment was spacious with a clean, contemporary kitchen, newer appliances, pleasant deck, lovely furnishings, and super clean bathrooms. The tiled, large master shower was awesome! Lake Michigan was a 1.5 mile walk (one way) each morning- and then we treated ourselves to Ann Sathers famous cinnamon rolls and coffee on the deck. We took the Red line train (public transportation) to downtown Michigan Ave, enjoyed an excellent meal at Reza's- Andersonville Persian restaurant- (an easy walk from the Guesthouse), and loved the numerous eclectic shops along Clark Street! There's even a food cart just a block away serving fresh tacos for $2.00- we bought a few everyday and they were delicious. We cooked several evening meals at the apartment and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed! Our 22 mos old grandson napped comfortably in the crib we requested.We were extremely happy with our time at the Anderson Guesthouse. The Andersonville neighborhood is delightful and lively- a fun place to explore!",5
Luxurious and spacious!,"We stayed in a very spacious 3-bedroom 2-bath unit that was comfortable, spotless, and well-appointed. The reservations process was a breeze and customer service is top-notch. Amenities include a balcony with seating, washer/dryer, garage parking, and a fully equipped kitchen. Andersonville is a lovely neighborhood with plenty of bar, restaurant, and shopping (grocery and other) destinations in easy walking distance. As a bonus there is a bus stop right outside the building that can get you downtown or connect you to the El with relative ease. Andersonville Guesthouse is a lovely respite away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. We would definitely stay here again!",5
As good as it gets!,Stayed here for 4 nights in June 2013 as part of a group of 3 couples and our own 14 month old son.,4

Another stellar weekend vaca!,"Love the Guesthouse - it is our go to spot in Chicago! Rick and the staff always make us feel right at home from the moment we walk in until the minute we check out. Comfy rooms, cozy wonderful beds, all the amenities you need in a nicely stocked kitchen, room to visit and enjoy time with family. We love the convenience and access to the Andersonville and Lincoln Square neighborhoods. There are several great coffee shops, restaurants, and wonderful shops near by and within walking distance. A new add right next door was Pick Me Up Cafe - a nice add to the neighborhood. We look forward to our next visit - it is already in the books!!",5
I finally have a wonderful place to stay that is truly dog friendly!,"I can‚Äôt say enough about The Guesthouse. Wonderful staff, beautiful spaces, great sheets and pillows, balcony with a view and my Greyhounds are welcome and comfortable:) I will most definitely be back!",5
Wonderful place to stay,"Great location, suites and staff were wonderful as well! Our dinner event space and coordination with caterer was handled so well by the hotel staff. Perfect! Only place we‚Äôll book for Chicago going forward!",5
Rude staff,Not a welcoming environment or experience! Staff behavior was rude and condescending. Desk staff demanded Identification for everyone in our group; insisting that we couldn‚Äôt proceed because our last group member was still bringing in her luggage. Although only one room key was given. Desk staff then proceeded to tell us that we needed to just ‚Äúdrink our wine and relax‚Äù for the evening as this is a quite rental. I have never been received like this by any hotel or resort I have ever stayed in. Although our accommodations were acceptable the staff was not!,1
Amazing hotel outside of downtown with all the amenities of home and very friendly staff!,"This place is amazing! Big thank you to Zoe, Paul, and Rick for all of their help during my stay! Very clean, and a home away from home. More like a condo than a hotel! Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again!",5
Absolutely Perfect for Long Term Stay!,"We often travel to Chicago/Andersonville to visit family, and over the years the Guesthouse has become our favorite hotel. In November we needed a place to stay for a full month during the COVID-19 lockdown. The Guesthouse became our oasis from the stresses of quarantining outside our family bubble. When we arrived, our apartment is spotless, as always. We love the spaciousness of the floor plan and the high ceilings. The shower in the master bath was luxurious -- five-star spa quality. The kitchen was fully equipped so that we could comfortably prepare and enjoy great meals for ourselves and also cook for our extended family. The grill on the deck was a bonus. I was able to reserve hour-long workout times in the downstairs exercise room, and I was also able to book the elegant library for Zoom meetings. The apartment is so quiet that you never know you‚Äôre in a lively urban setting. We loved having a reserved parking space in the garage, which was even equipped with an EV charger. The staff could not have been more helpful, attended our every need with great cheer. The Guesthouse tagline -- ""Live like a local""-- is spot on, and we hope to return again and again.",5
Perfect stay,Stayed there on a 6 day business trip. The location was perfect for relaxing in a quiet neighborhood after a busy day at the conference center downtown Chicago.,5

Perfect for a staycation or celebration,"I'm a local Chicagoan and live in the neighborhood so have walked by this property many times. As a former hotel guy, I have always wanted to venture in and check out this property as it looks so nice from the outside. I finally had the perfect opportunity to throw a small engagement party for a couple of friends. Rick, the General Manager, could not have been nicer and the front desk staff was superb throughout the stay. I would highly recommend this to any out-of-town guest but also to any locals who have a good reason to put someone up in a beautiful suite for a night. I cannot wait to plan my next outing here!",5

"We just stayed here for regretfully only 2 nights. The rooms are absolutely amazing with how beautiful and humongous they are at a fantastic price per night. The folks who work there are super friendly and helpful. Had both restaurant food and grocery delivery to there while there without any issues. It's well worth not being right on Michigan Ave. Easy to get to those main areas in minutes whether Uber or similar services, CTA, or walking.",,3
